Come out alone please fix
"Excuse me admin just for info, this application has an error. The book I borrowed couldn't find the file, so I couldn't open it üôè"
"I have signed up smoothly. Then when I was going to read a book (I managed to borrow it) I was just stuck writing download.... Please help, because this is very difficult for me. Thank you. *Edit: after 1 day, I'm not stuck anymore, I can read... Thank you, I hope iPusnas will be better in the future"
"THE BOOK IS OK, BUT THE APP IS GARBAGE SOMETIMES THERE'S NO PROBLEM ONLY STICKING ON THE LOGO. GOOD OI"
"I have registered, I can't login once, the password is wrong, the username or email is not valid, I want to reset my password, but the email doesn't come in, there's even a notification that the email wasn't registered, it's not clear, really, I tried to register again. notification is also that the email has been used (it said the EMAIL wasn't registered) what do you want, I sent a complaint via email, there was no reply, just wanted to delete the default"
"The bad thing is that I can't log in anymore. I wonder why??? But if you can log in, this application is really cool and very very helpful."
"It's very complicated how to register, it keeps failing"
"The application is good and very helpful for readers who have not had time to buy and read the physical book. Hopefully in the future there will be a wishlist feature, so that books that 'just want'/interested to read can be stored properly and don't be afraid to forget the title or find it hard to find later when you really have time to read :)."
"The books are good, but the system is still bad, there are still errors. Please fix . 2022: just keep on bugging, when will it be fixed"
Administration Ok
It really helps the spirit to continue to develop this application to be even better and provide more e-books.
good
Great application. Can you give me a suggestion to add the latest book collection feature so I can update what new books are there and from what date.
Burikk
How do I sound a notification when a book is available?
WHY CAN'T I DOWNLOAD THE BOOK?! WHY CAN I BORROW THE BOOK IN STATUS?
"In my opinion this application is good, but there are still some shortcomings. For example, there are no notifications when a book is available. You have to open the app first before the notification appears. And please increase the stock of books, so that the queues for books are not long and too long. One more thing, please add more books in the future. Thank you"
It's good to just add a dark mode because the system dark mode from the cellphone can't work on the application so please add a dark mode so it's not too torturous or I think this app has a dark mode/dark theme but it doesn't work properly
"The app is good. There is also a large collection of books. However, in my opinion, the quota for book borrowers is small, so I like to queue for a long time. Can you make more, bro?"
Can not login
The account suddenly went out by itself and when I wanted to log in I couldn't even though I've tried resetting the password and when I tried to write the password it even said an invalid email
Makes it easier for us to increase knowledge
The book can't be downloaded
Can not login
"Please fix it, I want to login, the next button can't be clicked!!"
Cannot open error For those who want to download please think about it first
very helpful
"I can't login, how can I use email? Using Facebook is just mental. Using the web email, I can't open it"
"I'll give you one star first. üôè How come I can't borrow the book? When I type the book I'm looking for, I can't even enter/read it"
"When you want to enter, you keep exiting the application yourself, even though the internet connection is smooth when used for other applications. Please fix it soon."
"The application is good, but there are some books that are not available and can only be borrowed for those who live in Jakarta."
Excellent
"the response when logging in is very long, but the internet is good."
"When I want to read a book it always comes out, even though I've installed and uninstalled it many times"
"Trying to borrow a book, then when I borrowed it stuck to the download button, I pressed it many times but still can't. I've changed the email and it doesn't work either. I also use another title but it's the same, it's still stuck on the download button. After uninstalling the application, it still gets stuck on the download button, it can't be read. I've tried 3 days but still can't. Solution please"
"Please add the book 'Son of Neptune' by rick riordan, the only problem is that book is not in the HoO series yet. It's really a suggestion for Ipusnas to add a feature to filter genres/types of books so that it's easier to find them, the notifications are also fixed so that they can appear more easily. Thank you very muchüôè"
thanks developer
"Why is this application taking so long, just entering the register takes a long time. Sorry admin, please fix it, this makes me feel better, plesed.üôèüò°"
"There are lots of books to read. There are best-selling books to books from well-known authors at iPunas. I love being able to read a lot of books in this app and it's also free. But the queue for the book is very long, it's only natural that it's also called a national library, many users use it. In the future, hopefully the stock of books can be increased to develop interest and reading habits."
Assalamualaikum...why can't I login
Cool a lot of knowledge
"Cool. I've borrowed dozens of books. Maybe you need to add a social room to chat between users. Edited 6/5/2022 Sorry, min. I reduced the stars. The problem is that it's been 2 weeks since the book I downloaded can't be read. Forced close continues. I have uninstalled & reinstalled, the problem is still the same."
thank you to the developers who have provided this application so that children of the nation can read books anywhere at any time. GBU
"The book collection is quite complete, but the appearance of the application when reading a book seems to flicker, so it's really annoying"
Force close only
Suggestion to add highlighter feature. And the only problem I'm experiencing is the queuing system. Please expand the collection or prioritize the person who queues first.
"As a reader, I feel happy because there is a legal application like this, especially since the book is also free. But why does the application like to logout itself? If you want to log in it also takes a long time, especially if you log in from Facebook. Hopefully in the future it won't be like that again"
"It's ugly, the error can't be downloaded even though it's already borrowed, how do you want to read it?"
"It's a really good application to add insight and knowledge about any things, but sometimes there are errors, hopefully the error problem will be resolved quickly, minüëç"
It's an error. Please fix it.. There are writings piled up
Very useful resource
It's good but likes to go out alone and there are still many bugs
"Its features have been growing, it's just a shame that the page marker feature is removed, so it's difficult to mark the last page read"
"The collection is large despite the endless queues of popular books, still okay for a science book. Need to improve again in terms of appearance. It is hoped that in the future it will have an attractive and easy interface design."
"great, it's been fixed and there are no problems when it opens. Hurry up, only one day to fix it. I hope there will be no more problems in the future. I also really like this apk, I've never been to a National Library and I really want to go there so I'm helped by the existence of this digital version of the National Library. thank you."
"Min, please add the category, new book category. So I know what books are new. You don't have to scroll for a long time to find a new book. Thank you"
"I'm looking for book references but apps keep coming out, they say there's a bug, they're told to update even though it's been updated"
Hopefully the longer the ipusnas collection will continue to grow.
"Instead of reading pirated books or reading books via free download pdfs, let's read books at iPusnas! Even though not all the books you want are here, this application is very complete!"
"The apk is good, it's just that when I'm reading it suddenly comes out by itself, then when I want to return the book why can't it? Please fix againüôèüèø"
"The app is great, but it would be nice if the book could support dark backgrounds. Because when I read in a dark place my eyes sting"
"I hope that in the future the ISpusnas application does not use borrowing time and abolishes the queuing system, or if you really want to create a system like that, at least there is no queuing system, and please increase the borrowing time, just imagine, we Indonesian people want to read and add insight when we have to queue first"
"Very helpful, very good, the complete book is here"
"Hi sis, why is this application difficult to login? Even though the password is the same as my email password. But why not, it keeps failing. Here the signal is also good. Is it really an error again? Please fix it, bro, I want to borrow the book too^^"
"Edit: Hi, can you fix the recommended book that comes out under the title we are opening? For example, is it still the same theme? Thank you! Developers are good, always answer and suggestions work, thank you!"
"Very useful, I like this app."
The best
"This digital library is quite good, runs smoothly and is good. There are a few things that I think should be improved: 1. Notifications don't appear when the queue book is already there. 2. Make page boundaries or reminders for each book, because I often forget, how many pages did I read in a book?. 3. The appearance is fresher and more simple but contains. 4. When borrowing a book, please give time, how much longer will the book be returned. 5. Create an invitation to read/motivation notification"
"Thank you developer and team for making & developing this very useful application, especially if it can be accessed for free-tis-tiss :D. I would like to recommend some good books that are not available at iPusnas: Men are from Mars Women are from Venus, Wonder, Deep Work, How to respect myself, The Death of Expertise, Malcolm Gladwell's books, and finally, hopefully in the future there will be good English versions. Indonesia doesn't exist. Hopefully the literacy of the Indonesian people will increase"
Please help ! I can't login
Good. Hmm. Why is it so hard to log in?
okay
After borrowing books. Open cannot be opened.
Still very far from the word comfort of the reader
The application is actually good but many of the letters are attached so they are not legible.
"Sorry, only 2 stars. Because my account suddenly went out by itself. Can't log in again. When I want to enter my email, it says ""Invalid email."" Even though the email is correct. I have also sent an email to the ipusnas email account, but there is no response. Please provide a solution. Thank you"
"It's been years, still the same, no improvement,, the talking star"
The book is incomplete
"The app is really good I've been reading it for 2 years when I left yesterday I just wanted to log in again but I couldn't How about this... PR for the developer... Even though the network is good, I tested YouTube smoothly, for storage I'm still relieved rom I'm 128 GB, the password and the email are correct, how come I didn't change it. Please, I can't if I have to go to the national library all the time."
"Its a ""good"" book"
"Why can't the curl paper transition be applied? keep stuck. When you leave the novel, when you want to read it again, you go back to the first thing, not the last thing you read, why is HD like that? Please fix"
"It's very good to read, chase your dreams as high as the sky Thank you so much"
Best
The application is quite often unusable. The initial page display freezes
"Sorry in advance, I have registered for an account 3 times but the email and username are invalid"
Nice app. Thanks.
"Good applications, the books are also interesting. Suggestions for adding various novels from various authors so that the choice of books is more varied, especially books from small authors, also adding more diverse book genre features so that the reading choices are more interesting. That's all, the rest is cool, hopefully the literacy culture will be sustainable :)"
Cool app. Very helpful
Really like
"Hello to the ipusnas development team. I am very happy because now I can read books on my cellphone. But honey. I have borrowed a book, but I can't. Please, the crew and the team, please correct it immediately, or if possible, give a tutorial when you first enter so that we all understand. Okay that's it from me. Thank you"
"Kerenn, hopefully in the future it can be better y"
"The screenshot feature, please do it again, so I can invite people to like reading too, by telling me a good book quote"
"Unfortunately there is no wishlist feature, so I can't list any books I want to read in the future."
"Large collection of books, fast interruption service."
"After the update, there are a lot of bugs, it's better for the previous version, there are no bugs"
"the book collection is complete and good, but the application itself often has bugs and errors, please fix it"
"I ask that iPusnas can provide a feature to return books before 1 √ó 24 hours, because sometimes books that have already been borrowed turn out to be not according to interest."
I hope it can be improved even more
"Cool application, add insight"
Why can't I login anymore?
"can't login, please fix it"
"Assalamualaikum, I'm Yudi, I'm asking for help. Please fix the book so that blind children with disabilities can read it, thank you"
Give 4 stars because the novel is incomplete. But the religious and spiritual people like it.
"Assalamu'alaikum wrwb, in advance I apologize profusely, I would like to ask for help if it is not yet available, please provide it. format so that the contents of the books in Ipusnas can be read by us blind people. All features, menus, titles and descriptions of the book have been accessed, all that's left is the contents of the book, because it really helps us, thank you."
"The verification email is complicated, it fails, the email link is always the verification code is not valid even though all the data is correct"
Can't open it gaje
"Sad, undeveloped, lots of bugs, can't read, can be returned, force close"
Very useful for the nation
Please add books on linguistics. Thank you
"Books that have been borrowed are always lost, even though they have been downloaded. notes that have been made are also often lost. Hmm, please fix it, it's very annoying."
"good, but it takes too long to load."
I like reading so just 5 stars
Can you log in?
Krennn
Please increase the stock of books üôè so as not to cause too many queues üôèüôè
good collection
It's very difficult to register. Email is correct but still not working.
"The application is really good, bro üëç but please add illustrated comics for children, so it's easier to read, that's all my review Hope it helps, Greetings literacyüôè"
"Limited stock, please add because the queue is very long and I just got a notification when I checked it was already in the queue position again üòä"
"There are a lot of good books, it's good for increasing knowledge, but there are also many shortcomings, from starting to load long even though the network is good, I've downloaded the book but can't read it offline like before, etc., disappointed, but hopefully it can be fixed again!"
"It's a shame when I want to read a book it just gets stuck on the download icon and as a result the book can't be read, please the developer to fix the bug in the iPusnas application. Thank you"
Very helpful
"Very good application, suitable for readers. It's a pity that there are very few novel books. If you can add."
"I want to read on a tablet. Tablet GT-N5100 with android 4.42 declared incompatible. I wonder why....? Even though the Ipusnas requirements that I know can be for Android 4 and up. Cook, do you have to buy a new tablet....???? Read on the cellphone the writing is too small."
"Min, the apk is good and very useful, I want to make a paper using book sources, but sorry, min, it's so slow even though the signal is smooth, my account hasn't been logged in since earlier, please fix it, bro, because the apk is very useful Edit: Minn Why do I want to look for another book that has been typed in another that came out, please fix it, min, I really need it, because"
"It's good, but why is there no notification when the book is available? I've missed a few times when the book entered the queue, when I wanted to borrow it, the stock ran out... because there wasn't a pop up notification ""book (title) is available"""
"As an application made by the government, this application is still less stable. There are a lot of bugs. Like when you open a borrowed book, you force close it, and so on, please fix it"
How come this error often happens? Please for the developers so that they respond quickly if there are problems. Because lately the server is often down. Thank you
Application cannot be opened
Why can't I login even though I just updated to the latest version? The internet network is also good
Recommendation.!
"Not bad, it can save our expenses, the bookworms. But unfortunately, the collection is incomplete. Suggestion: Hopefully it will be updated with the latest novels and the stock, if possible, is more than 10 so that the queue is not long."
Already good. But why doesn't the book queue notification on my cellphone turn on? Is ipusnas no notification available?
"This application is good, but there is still a lot of homework for developers. Comments can't be posted even though the connection is good, and do you know that this application can't display notifications? Even though the notification permission is activated, but every time a book I'm waiting for is available, no notification or message appears. Then the cover of the book is also often loading, not according to the title. And, of course, I still expect 'page thickness' to be available for the next update."
"It's good, but sometimes the book crashes and can't be opened :)"
"Not complete.. I'm looking for a lexicography book, it's not there?"
Why can't the application be used?
I want to reset my password but why is the web error yaaaa!!!!
Very good for people who like to read books like me
"There is no page search feature or go to page ... , so if you want to continue reading the book again, you have to scroll down..."
nice
I like
Very nice...
"Thank you for the ebook, it was very helpful. Add the ebook collection, especially Islamic economics. Good Job"
"So good, but after borrowing GK, you can borrow it again :("
Can't login. He said maintenance . Have tried many times
"I give 5 stars to appreciate this app and it really helps me who likes to read, but I have a few suggestions and input for this app. 1. At first it went smoothly but for the past few days it couldn't be opened, aka just loading. 2. There is no deadline for our reading, so if we have not finished reading and we leave, then if we want to read again we have to scroll first. That's all, thanks for Ipusnas."
"why is the network error, it's taking so long to load"
"I can't borrow because there's no email confirmation. The email confirmation wasn't sent, how do you want to confirm the blog?"
"Being provided with this book online is very grateful. Applications that really support the increasing literacy of the Indonesian people, then what are people really waiting for to be able to read? yes intention and time. Passion for a better Indonesia. Thank you library."
"I always don't get it when I line up for a famous author's novel, please add a copy"
Cool
"When you register for the first time, why is your email or username always invalid? Please enlighten üôè"
"I like ipusnas to read lessons, the main story, I like it, I give it five stars"
"very helpful for us, parents, in assisting children to learn."
"bugs in the application are very annoying. every scrolling page, the dark mode & light mode bugs change continuously. but overall it helps me with my college assignments"
Slow login
"Min, I want to ask, how do I read the book, I clicked on borrow a book and then clicked DWLD I can't,, it's important, Min, to do the paper, please, how come it's getting an error huhuhu"
Good app
Thank you
Really good
"The books are abundant, cool, but the copies of the books need to be reproduced, which has a lot of queues"
"Why can't I register when I register? Written, my email is invalid. How could that be? I wrote correctly, but still invalid. Likewise when using another email."
good
The app is pretty good. Suggestions if you can add a dark mode feature so that your eyes don't get tired easily.
I give three stars not without reason. Applications are often under maintenance and this is quite annoying. Even though this application is very helpful for finding reference sources for reading material
"The application is very useful, in addition if there is a favorite book button so that later before downloading or those who want to download, they can be favorited"
"The apk is complicated, the login is complicated, just want to read it, it's very difficult"
Keyen
"Please, I'm very comfortable using Ipusnas. I'm always willing to queue there. I always make Ipusnas my reading house to review on Instagram in the end. But suddenly yesterday, Ipusnas left its own account. Then when you register again, you can't. I think my password is still the same, yesterday I was able to log in on ig. But why with ipusnas? Hooo, please help, yes. I want to read again, huhuuuu :)"
Hi..i just downloaded this app..but why? I want to borrow the book it always fails...please help üôèüôè
"Sorry, min 2 stars, even though I used to like reading here. But the more it's updated, the weirder it gets. My account has always been linked, so my email is invalid. I've tried several times to uninstall, delete install, and so on. Please give me a solution"
"Very useful, because we can read many books for free here, especially for people who live in remote areas like me. Thank you National Library of Indonesia üôè"
Nice and very helpful
"There are a lot of errors, plus there can't be one account for two devices"
"Please, every time I want to read a book I have to log in again, even though I'm already logged in."
"Frequent errors, please fix it again"
Why is this the first error when you want to borrow? The server is under maintenance or there are no items that have been held or failed. Is it really being repaired?
"The more the application is updated, the worse it gets. Even though the connection is good but the book download keeps failing. Ipusnas has lost its function. So I give 1 star. Later when it can be downloaded then I will add the star."
"Ipusnas is good and the ebook collection is quite complete. but please min, to change the minimum time for returning the book, if possible after opening or reading it can be returned without having to wait 1 x 24 hours..."
"Only 1 is missing, the cover of the book is ugly Ô∏èüòÖ, so it doesn't attract readers"
"The application is very good!. All the books that I have read are here. A little advice, please add school textbooks here. Thank you iPusnas üëç"
"Can't read books. when I want to open it, it comes out"
Benefit
"The application is very helpful, but still often errors and logouts itself. Books that have been borrowed and want to be borrowed back don't even exist. Like the track book of Islam in the Archipelago by Adi Teruna Efendi"
often the monochrome ig display error may be fixed to make it more modern
"PLEASE Whoever YOU ARE, WOULD LECTURER OR STUDENT PLEASE IF YOU FINISHED READING, RETURN THE BOOK!! ALREADY GIVEN FREE FOR THE PUBLIC EVEN ABUSED."
"Hello admin, can admin confirm my login? I have tried repeatedly to login via email or FB on the Ipusnas application, but still can't. But after logging in, I almost managed to do it, but the application stopped suddenly. I beg to be responded to and further followed up because this ipusnas application is very meaningful for my needs in lecturesüôèüèª Thank you very much in advanceüôèüèª"
"Assalamu'alaikum Sis, I want to ask what is the difference between offline mode and online mode, please explain"
"Thank you iPusnas thanks to the help from iPusnas I was able to go to the library again but online due to this covid-19 pandemic, thank you again üôè"
"The GUI is not satisfactory, but thank you for helping to provide the book."
"Already registered, but when you click download there is no action. Information please."
"I really like this application, it can make a mess. Just the book I'm looking for most of the queues are long...."
Why can't I log in? My account is correct.
"Very nice. The loan period is too short and the queues are long for certain books, even years. Please add the borrowing period and the number of books so you don't have to wait long"
Why is it always when I want to read a file that I can't find the title even though I'm looking for it
"The experience of being able to read books at iPusnas was very pleasant, but every time you had to wait in line to be able to read what book you chose. Because the stock of books is limited"
"I just realized there are some deleted e-books here huh...? Well, that's too bad I wanted to read it. Hmmm, but there are some new e-books to replace them, only if you can add e-books, don't delete some of the old ones too."
I want to ask why the book I'm looking for can't be found in the application
The collection per unit title is more if you can.
"Good all the stories really like it, all the stories are interesting üëçüèªüëçüèª"
"It's really good, I hope the number of books can be increased. Overall it's comfortable to use Ipusnas. Yok, don't regret being dyslexic due to lazy reading"
Often force close when reading a book on a certain page
"It's been so good! But a little suggestion, the page you want to go directly to is better to just type because not all books include segments/chapters, and it's also a good idea to use the word search feature to apply to all books. Thank you!"
Please add a copy of the book to make it easier for those who want to read it. Thank you
"Good app, 72k books are here!!? But syngg, often lags alone, comes out on its own, worse... Error until the book can't be returned üôè please fix it ASAP. It's good that there are many books, although there are books that are not available, but there are always additions to the collection."
"It's very difficult to login, now you can. My advice is to make a choice to sign in or create an account for those who don't have an account so that it's not complicated."
"The application is completely useless, most of the bugs"
Excellent
Why can't I borrow a book through an unverified account
"I like it, but why aren't there new books available, the collection is too small for the size of a national library, it's a bit disappointing"
"Please how come it's been borrowed and put it on the shelf, why can't it be downloaded, can't read"
"It's really good, and the variety of the book is also pretty good üëç. I'm excited, I hope you continue to update the latest books üëçüòÅüí™üí™"
"Very good application. My advice, if the borrowing period of the book is up, please don't delete the bookmark, so you can continue reading it in the next borrowing period, considering that there are many books that are difficult to complete in just 3 days. Thank you."
"Can't login using gmail email... It says username or email is invalid, why is this?????"
The application is great for increasing our knowledge
"The book is incomplete, and it's hard to find the book you want to read, once you find it, it's out of stock"
Too bad Ipusnas doesn't have a dark mode
Please add the stock of books with the most queues
"Hi, iPusnas! Introduce my name is Umi. This afternoon I downloaded the iPusnas application but why when I wanted to register I was told to try again ""Invalid username or email name""? I've tried changing the name and replacing it with my other email, still can't. Please help, thank you üôè."
"There are still many incomplete books. Please make the best selling book available if you can, you don't need a limit to read"
It's really hard to log in
"It's been downloaded, I want to borrow a book, but I ask for email verification and the application system is confusing.. It's complicated!!"
"I can't login, I just installed it"
"Cool, can read a lot of ebooks. But sometimes the error makes it annoying. Then don't make a lot of queues, developers. It's going to be a long time because"
"Min, how come I can't log in even though there's no problem with email?"
Noise
Why can't the book be downloaded? How do you get to read the book? Very upset to see this application. Application is not clear
"why can't when registering, often re-verify"
"Very good, but unfortunately I can't log in, why huh?üò≠"
"It's good, but there are a lot of books that are out of stock, if you can, give a policy for the time of the readers, bro, so I can replace them. Maybe there are some people who only keep the book but don't read it, so maybe a policy is given for the time of borrowing, after the borrowing period is over, you can delete it from the shelf immediately üôè"
"Actually, this application is very useful and helps the nation's children to be more diligent in reading, but unfortunately the collection is not complete, especially for the world's best seller books, even if there are very few stocks so you have to queue for a long time. While literature is one of the best investments in the education of a nation. So please make developers consider adding to the collection. Besides that, unfortunately, this application does not yet have a save feature to read later & archive books that we have borrowed"
"I have been using ipusnas for a long time. Initially there were no problems at all. But suddenly I can't log in. I don't know why even though my email is still active. It's been over and over again still. Asked for a password change, too. According to my instructions, fix it. The result is the same. I give 5 stars because I used to use it without any problems. Please help, bro. Thank you"
Increase people's reading interest and save time
"Can't login, lol"
Why are you lag?
The book can't be borrowed even though you have logged in using your email
Help
"Why is there a limit on books that can be borrowed, don't make a book limit, so everyone can freely read the same book without a maximum book limit for borrowing and having to queue"
"cant enter,"
"Sorry, it took a long time to enter the application, even though the network is stable"
"It's good, but it's not updated, it's faster to update, min, moreover, there are a lot of new books, please, bro, thank you very much"
"If you want to read books or novels for free and of course illegal, you can download this application."
"Can't download books, even though the signal is loud!"
"login via facebook can't, and I hope the login method is added with gmail, thx"
"This is a strange application concept, if you can download it, why do you have to queue up to read it. The name of technology is made to make it easier...haehhh it makes Indonesian people more lazy to read"
Reading books is easier and cheaper. Thanks for always updating new books.üëçüèª
I'm having a hard time finding the novel I want to read... is it actually complete or not?
Hello. The application is very good. Equipped with features that make us comfortable while reading. Please in the future the book collection will be added and the fantasy genre will also be added. Thank you.
"Well, for a long time I always failed, in logging in,, until I deleted this application, then I saw it on youtube, and thank God,, I was given a tw of how, it turns out that there is a message going to QT's email, there is a suggestion for qt email verification..., wait until there is a word that works, then you can become a member.. The point is, be patient, don't be in a hurry,, thank you all.. And hopefully those who read this will be given. Ease in good things and cheap sustenance and blessings amen"
"If you can, add a text to speech feature"
"Already downloaded can not be used even though already logged in via Facebook. Every time you want to read a book, you wait in line/empty, even if there is a book available if you want to borrow it, there is a statement ""Not yet a member? Please enter the password to become a member. Register now"". After I click Register now it still ""enter your password"". This really makes me even more confused about registration. Sorry I will uninstall this application. Thank you."
I don't know if it's just all the readers' cellphones on my cellphone. Why does the screen often go out when we read? Why doesn't the screen stay on while reading. So that it will make it easier for readers who don't need to unlock the cellphone several times because the screen often turns off by itself.
"I like it, I like it, it's very useful,, üòçüòçüëçüëçüëç"
"Please fix, I can't login repeatedly. Already asked for help email to reset password but still failed."
"It's too bright, it's good that there is a night mode so the eyes are not too tormented.. there is a night mode in this application but only on the edges there are still a lot of white ones.. maybe it can be updated again"
"I'm disappointed, I can't just login, even though it's clear that the email and password are not wrong, please fix it!"
"The application is very good, it really helps me in college. It's just sad that there are some books that are not available here. I hope it's more complete"
1 word COOL!!!!
"hello min. It's been 2 months when I want to read a book, the application always comes out by itself, why? Please fix üôè. It becomes difficult if you want to do assignments and read other books. Thank you"
He has a large collection of books and novels. And most importantly free. It's also easy to register to be able to read on Ipusnas. Thank you iPusnas
"Can't read yet because the stock of the book is out, btw I'm a new user :D"
Very nice
"Sorry in advance, why can't the borrowed book be downloaded?"
"very nice, thank you!!!"
"I don't know what to write, the point is that it's been represented by previous people's comments"
"How do I read on my cellphone, how come I can't download it, always read it on the desktop leptoo sob"
"Min, when will the new books be updated? Like the novel tere liye, there hasn't been a new update?"
Why can't the borrowed book be downloaded?
"How come, sis, how come I want to log in, I can't want to read, I can't, please fix the application again"
"Add more to the collection. Please fix the page reading history again. In the past, when you left a book page, what appeared was the last page you read. Now it can't, always the start page that appears. Please fix it like before! (Apparently still not fixed)"
"Please, please, the book is very useful for college students"
"Bugs a lot, and there should be a notification to make it easier if a book is available and a message comes in!"
"After downloading, I want to read the book, the login takes too long. Can't you read the book?"
"Min, I want to ask why I can't login, right? It always failed. I used to really enjoy reading books, now I can't even log in...."
The application is very good. Many collections of books that are recommended for reading.
Very easy.... Like it.... And suitable for readers like me
Can't download the book
Too bad I can't register since yesterday
Ipusnas why now I can't log in :( it's really sad. This holiday I want to read as much as I can while staying at home.
Complete library
"There are not many copies of well-known books and important books, so the queue is too long, waiting in line for too long, if you are in a hurry to do assignments you don't even have the books, better find someone else"
Why is it difficult for me to borrow books?? Even though last week I was able to borrow a book
"Min, why do I have a book downloaded but I can't read it, it's useless, I'm downloading this ipusnas"
More collections please
"I hope all the books have a highlight feature, because it's really necessary"
Heaven on earth for us book lovers. Without having to leave the house we can explore the world. Thank you iPusnas.
"hello sis. Previously, let me give another suggestion. I think we provide a highlighter feature(?) where we can mark which words/parts are important or we like and maybe we can add a quote feature so that we can attract other people to read and at the same time promote Ipusnas for free üôè. That is all and thank you"
Add the general book of S1 management lectures
"Hi IPUSNAS, why are you still saying nonsense, I've updated the password given by IPUSNAS, but still can't access it because the email is invalid, you trash!"
"The available books are incomplete, hopefully in the future there will be more books related to motivation, economics, and also related to Islamic books"
Can't comment on the book. Isn't that the case with the others? Ô∏è
"Try adding a feature that has been read, bro, yes, it's been a long time, you have to start over again"
"Good application, can increase reading interest of all circles. All kinds of readings are here."
"add a wishlist feature or the like! so that users can collect books that they want to read next time. In addition, also add a night mode so that your eyes don't get tired while reading."
"Hello ipusnas, why can't I read the book? Always exit the app when I click read. It says the application restarts. sob"
"Please, our developers strongly recommend a dark theme for the iPusnas apk, for the convenience of readers. Ready, thank you."
Great üëçüëç
"Please help me why today I'm having trouble logging into Ipusnas. In fact, since the beginning of February, I have not experienced any problems. It's suddenly being thrown out of my account even though it's not logged out. Going back to the bookshelf, everything is empty, even though I used it yesterday, it was fine. Please help so I can read again smoothly. Thank you!"
"It's good, it's quite complete, please add a special mystery feature for adults, then it's likely to be more crowded, the features are not paid so it's convenient, even if the content is complete, it might be able to compete with google play books in Indonesia"
Why is it so hard to enter? Must verify email but where? I've checked my email and it's not there either. So no one can open the novel
The app is very good and useful. But unfortunately after I uninstall it can't log in again. I tried using another account but it doesn't work. Please make it easier to log in and register
Does the notification only appear in the application?
"I like it, but there's a bit of a bug"
Interesting and very helpful for my hobby in reading books.
Good very helpful
"The application is very helpful and I start reading books diligently in the future, hopefully there will be more books :)"
Hello developers. Why does the application automatically exit every time you want to read the book? Please help
"Complicated registration. There's already an option to sign in with fb or create an account. Already logged in using a fb account, still asked for email registration. Why did you choose to log in using fb?"
"Thank you for being a bridge for low-badgets to continue reading the works of their favorite authors. Just a suggestion, more updates for the books."
Daughter
"Very good application. Also useful. As a suggestion, please add a collection of books. It's a shame if the best-selling novels such as Laskar Pelangi, the dreamer, Edensor, and other novels are not available here."
Grateful that there is an app like this
"The reading experience with iPusnas is quite satisfying, although some of the well-known book stocks are very less than the number of enthusiasts."
"I looked for Books about agriculture, but nothing!"
Why does every borrowed book suddenly come out by itself?
Thank you for facilitating us to read the book. Really like
It is enough to help students of Indonesian language and literature education study programs like me.
There are not many books. Sometimes the search is also not in sync with the results. The appearance is not attractive even though it belongs to the state but looks like a trash cake
"Since it was first downloaded about a week ago, it has been used smoothly, and I am very happy with this application. But why is there a problem today? So I've downloaded borrowed books, they're already on the bookshelf. But when it opens it doesn't work, it always goes back to the start menu. I've deleted the memory and application data, re-downloaded the book but the book still can't be opened. The error description: ""Ipusnas was closed because there was a bug. Try updating the application after there is a fix from the developer"". How about this?"
"It's really suitable for those who like to read books but don't have time to go to Gramedia, it's very easy and free too. Highly recommended ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
"Cool, hopefully this application continues to grow üëçüëç"
"min, I just downloaded the apk but the apk can't open"
"Wait, wait and wait until you get old and then die. Actually, this ""ipusnas"" intends to borrow books or not!?? If the intention is to increase public literacy, the reader should not be told to wait CONTINUOUSLY, the basis for the application of the ""GOIB"" book."
"Alhamdulillah, thanks to this iPusnas application, it can make it easier for me when I want to read books. Especially if you want to add references for papers, this application is very helpful. It's just that sometimes the application logouts itself, but that's okay, hopefully in the future it will be better."
Mantappp
Why can't the book be downloaded?
"iPusnas is a very useful application. Thanks to all parties involved. But I found 1 bug in the application, namely the application will force close if I use landscape mode in the middle of reading a book. I'm using a tablet galaxy s2 8.0 with android version 7.0. Please update the application so that it supports landscape mode."
very helpful but sometimes lags
"Dreaming... how to mark the last time you read a book in 1 format again (the last time you read it) how's that, min"
"Hello, admin, I want to ask if the server is from ipusnas maintenance, please respond as soon as possible, min :)"
"Min, I'm trying to open the iPusnas application today, I can't do it at all, when I try to open it, only the National Library of Indonesia logo appears, it takes so long to load there so I can't enter the homepage at all, min...please fix it"
It's okay
I really like it... I hope there will be more collections
It's really good to know digital books
I can't read :(
Really like this application because it is very helpful for channeling my reading hobby
Please add the stock of books. I've been queuing for almost 5 months and I'm not happy too.
good
"The app is good.. I'm new to using it.. So far, in my opinion, what's lacking is the wishlist feature.. So if there's a book that you want to like first, which will be read later, put it on the wishlist first.."
Very nice.
"Very good apk for people who like to read. but it's far from campus or you don't have an interesting book to download, you won't regret it"
"Cool, very helpful, I hope there will be more collections of books, aaamiin"
"aaaaaaaa i love it!! so you can read books for free and offline. My suggestion is to add another best selling book. hopefully the application will develop more (anw I read more often after downloading ipusnas hihi) but sometimes you have to queue, but that's okay instead of buying pirated books, big no."
"The application is good. If you can suggest, in the category menu, if you can be more specific, for example the history category, it is further divided whether national history, regional history or world history, whether elementary, junior high, high school or college mathematics or general mathematics"
"Can't log in to read books, I tried to login via Facebook but still can't, I don't really regret downloading"
"I'm getting a bit of an error right now? Every time I open the apk, it's like an initial restart and then it doesn't stop, I'm told to click continue then it doesn't stop"
"Maybe if you add more genres, it will be easier for readers to find the genres they like."
The best
"realize that reading is important, for anyone....try it"
Very nice
"Wow, the apk is really good, especially if there is an event, it's even better :)"
"It's really good that the application helps those who don't have the cost to buy books so they can read for free. I just want to ask that the person who uploaded the book is really a member of the National Library or an ordinary member like me? And why is there a limit on the number of copies of the book, which is only a dozen, why not make it unlimited but have a time period, which is quite strict, for example only 3 days after that if you want to borrow the same book you have to wait for example 1 week or 1 month?"
Don't make an error how to read
"I like to go out alone, but tbtb the book I borrowed is gone. Shibal"
It's fun to get a story
"I think this apk is good. It's just that it's a bit difficult to go back and forth and the loading is a bit crashing so that many similar books appear. Keep improving, Developers! Thank you!"
Why can't I register on the iPusnas application? Please long dependents. Even though I like the application
"The application is not good for religious students, the book is lacking"
"Those who say the last page can't be known, certainly don't know the pinned menu. Look for it. It's easy. So when you want to read again, you don't have to scroll. That's an old menu... Thank you ipusnas. It's good to read here the quality books are better than installing random story applications."
"It's good, so it's economical to buy books. Here's a suggestion, I hope you get noticed, if you can add a highlighter pen feature so that every sentence that the reader thinks is important, you can color it. Also for the search feature, hopefully I can search with the publisher's keywords, for example (gpu, grasindo, our media, etc.) because I tried to search with the publisher's key but I can't."
Thank you very helpful
Very nice
"Thank you, the ipusnas application is getting better and better. Hopefully the book collection will increase, so you don't have to queue long when you want to borrow books, especially books related to education, often don't have time to borrow books (‰∫∫ ‚Ä¢Õà·¥ó‚Ä¢Õà)"
Make more insight
"Open the application, you have to wait a few days, it takes too long to load"
Books by great people are not listed as more children's books
"Very good application.. Useful, I rate 4/5..hopefully it can be even better"
"Complaints have been well resolved, thanks to the development team for being willing to work around the bugs. Hopefully ipusnas will be better and more comfortable to use. Keep moving forward my Indonesia, Greetings literacy!"
üôè
"Hello, so I just updated the OS yesterday and after the update, every time I want to read the book, the application closes automatically, I want to report how confused I am"
Why are book loans limited? Isn't this a digital book that should be easily accessible to everyone without having to go to the library?
Very good
"The application is good, if you can increase the collection of books related to literature‚ò∫"
Why should allow this app to read our phone contacts? Did you get a phone call when you read the history of the PKI? Can you please explain why this has to be done on Android while it's not done on desktop.
So far it's been good and for future suggestions to increase the collection of books
"can't read the book, it keeps coming out"
The Ipusnas application is very useful. Can read books anytime and anywhere. Please add more to the collection. When will Dan Brown's novel - The Davinci Code be on Ipusnas? Please also add Mark Manson's book-The Art of Being Stupidly Stupid. Hopefully in the future it will be better.
"Thank God, I can finally read books for free even through an application. Where I don't have a library, even if there is one in the city.. With this application, it is very easy for me to read books... I say thank you very much to the ladies and gentlemen who played a role in making applications and books that are in it... once again Thank you thank you very much^-^"
"Although not perfect, the government has fulfilled its promise. To the developer, please don't make the login session permanent, right because it's a hassle to have to log in again to the app, you just have to log in on PC and Android from the beginning. Hope you don't log in once, because this is not a financial application :)"
"Business and mindset books as well as digital marketing, please add"
"This is a really good application, I suggest that if there is a push notification, so that I can borrow quickly, I don't always go first when I'm waiting in line!"
Btw..This application is really good..You can read as many books as you want and hopefully can continue to provide new developments in Indonesian education.üòâüòáüòä
"Cool, iPusnas has accompanied me during college until now, always improve to make it more interestingüëçüèª"
"The application makes it easy to find references, it would be nice if the files were multiplied so that there were not many queues and if possible the books would be completed again üòä"
"Please increase the stock of books, every time I open one book, the stock runs out, how do I want to read it? The application is good, in the future please be better"
"My input, please update the display, it's more colorful, better, fresher.... so that it's more comfortable and delicious"
"Overall the application is good, but there is no feature of the last page read that makes you have to scroll if you want to continue reading. If you're reading a long book, you'll get annoyed with scrolling. Even though there is a search feature, we don't necessarily know the last word we read. Please fix"
"Hello Admin, I really like this application. I want to give a suggestion 1. I want the DM feature with fellow Ipusnas users to have a reply feature or reply to messages, basically the DM feature can be like WhatsApp so that Ipusnas is cooler 2. I really want the book I'm in line to have a notification and appear on the status bar of my cellphone and the notification sounds. 3. I would like to have more copies of the book, especially books like Tere Liye's. Thank you Ipusnas üôèüèª‚ú®"
"The application is cool, very useful, very useful for people who want to read books but don't have enough money or can also be a reference to find good books to read. But there is something that must be added in the shortcomings of this application, namely the collection of books is not much. I hope the developer considers adding more books to it. Thank you"
It is good that there are many books that can be used as references for assignments.
"found this apk via the ig homepage. I just downloaded it, I hope it's satisfying"
"Min, why is it that after the application was updated, the books that were there were no longer there? At the beginning of the Ipusnas download in December, the Earth Tere Liye serial novels were still complete in the search. After updating, there are only six left. Where are the others? Please fix the application"
"This is why every time you want to borrow a book, you have to verify your email first even though it's already been verified"
Really Want to Learn
"Good, but why did my account go out, keep trying to log in again I can't log in"
"Can't login or register again. How to do? Even though when I read it, I had to log in first."
Cool
"The collection is pretty complete, but how come there is borrowed stock, so little stock? It's a digital book, how come it's in stock?"
"A very useful application, the collection of books is also getting more and more interesting... my advice if there is a notification feature like that, if the queue book is already available, so even though we don't open the application anymore we know the book is available and can check it right away Thank you"
"Add a feature to view the book's table of contents to make it easy to choose books to borrow. The policy of ""borrow first then find out the contents of the book"" makes it difficult for us to choose, so we often choose the wrong book. Only found out after the book was borrowed. Even though the policy of ""24 hours can only be returned"" means that it cannot be returned immediately (which was the wrong choice earlier). The existence of a synopsis is not much help, because it depends on the author of the synopsis. It's more fun to look at the table of contents and skim."
"It's really hard to log in, please fix the applicationüôèüôèüôèüôè"
"It's trash, share it, if it's corrupted, you can't log in"
"I am very happy with this application, it makes it easier for us to find references but it would be nice if the books that were there were added again, because there are so many books that I want to read but they are not in Ipusnas"
"I have changed it to 5 stars, the application is running well and can be used smoothly. Finally I can read reference books for my college assignments. Thank you"
Excellent
"It's really helpful, it's really amazing"
"It's easy to find the book, but once you find the book, you can't read it with a screenreader. So there is less access for blind screen reader users aka talkback"
"The application is cool, one of the government's efforts to make it easier for people to improve the quality of reading, in the future the socialization must be massive again so that its effectiveness is felt by many people, and please allow screenshots for the application so that when you find interesting things in a book you can immortalize it."
"Sorry, I want to say why the application takes so long to search, I've updated it and it's still the same. Policy please üôè"
"I don't know the application, force close, it's annoying"
why bug bug
"It's been a long time since I've opened Ipusnas, then I'm only now opening it, in terms of appearance, it looks better, but why are so many features missing? or maybe there's an error (?) ‚Äîlike the table of contents and the last page read that don't exist. even though it's really important because I find it quite difficult if I have to scroll again from the beginning. with one more suggestion, please add the delete reading history feature to make it neater. Thank you"
"It's really annoying, I swear, it's my turn to log in to borrow a book and even ask for verification that I've entered the password, it still fails. Then try again, the data is deleted, then enter the e-mail and password, but the password is wrong, the game is right, even though it's correct. How do you make it difficult?"
"It's pretty good...some history books that I've been wanting to read for a long time are here. Suggestion: If possible, add more history book collections, especially World War 1 and World War 2 because there are so many fans, for example: European War volumes 2 and 3 by PK. Ojong, - Pacific War by PK. Ojong. -Air War in Europe by Darma Aji -Citizen Soldiers by Stephen E.Ambrose -Band Of Brothers by Stephen E.Ambrose."
"It didn't work... It turned out to be really good, but the book was lacking... But that's okay, it's a good app... Ô∏è"
"I really like it, even though sometimes I get errors"
"Please improve the procurement of books, if possible, add novels and foreign references that have been translated into Indonesian heheh"
What's up with you my favorite app? Almost a week can't open :'(
Very helpful
"Sorry, I really want to read, but lately I've been having trouble getting in. Why does the application only load the welcome page and cannot enter the home page, book loans, etc.? Please help."
"Please separate the book into sections per genre, don't make all genres (religion, history, romance, etc.) one, complicated. Also please make a billboard of the Top 10 most popular books by genre. If possible, update the UI so that it can keep up with the times. Thank you"
"Please add more best selling books. Then I added a copy of the book, I really wanted to borrow one of the books but had to queue up and even then it took months. An example is the novel Bumi by Tere Liye."
"This application is actually good, but why can't my account be opened, huh? I've been trying to open it for two days, but it keeps failing. info please,"
PLEASE FIX IT ALREADY 3 DAYS OF SERVER MAINTENANCE
"Good, but hopefully in the future the server speed will be upgraded again, the features are also hopefully there will be other innovations, such as bonus points that can be used to access other features etc... thank you"
My suggestion please add Dark Mode .
Just can download again
Is there a search menu? It's hard to find book titles one by one
"How do I enter my account, but I still can't say verify the account first but I can't help someone please help"
Reading books is very helpful in many ways
"Just updated, but why can't it be opened??"
It's really strange the apk login doesn't go in
Please guide for book help
"I like blanking, I'm really annoyed"
Please notify me when the book is available :') I want to borrow often out of stock. And also given a time limit for borrowing
"Permission for suggestions is given a notification if there is a notification, so that if you queue, you don't miss a book. Thank you"
The app is so cool. But when the notification queue sometimes doesn't appear like that
Indonesian mandatory application
"Please, please, give me the option of extending the borrowing of books, so if you haven't finished reading, you don't need to search for book titles again... And hopefully there won't be any more errors and more book collections"
Annoying
very helpful
good
My suggestion please add an olympic book. Thank you
"Very easy, time and place efficient. Continue to improve, and add more collections of books. #IndonesiaReading"
I can borrow again.. tks. Many good books that I can read from here
"The book is quite complete, good for looking for references, but why can't the books that have been borrowed/downloaded be opened?? Always exit the application, and a warning appears ""ipusnas keeps exiting"" Please fix it again"
very helpful
"It's pretty good, although there are problems in some places (errors)."
"Wow, the ipusnas is really good, I got and borrowed a lot of English books and it can make us smarter, thank you üòäüôÇ"
The book cannot be downloaded. SUCKS
"It's back to normal, thank you Kang Develop and the people who have worked well"
Beneficial
it's okay to read when you're not busy
It's not clear you should be able to download it for free
Keep on educating
"Troubleshooting is good although a bit slow. The book collection is quite complete. Suggestions: 1. Provide an option to delete book history in the User Profile section to make it look more presentable. (there are several books that have been borrowed so many times that it counts as 2) or, the same book that has been borrowed is not included in the History on the User Profile. 2. In the future, we hope to add to the collection of books."
Why can't it open?
"It's not very clear, everyone uses a queue -_- I think you can read a book anytime and anywhere haha"
"Why does this keep on repeating, okay?"
Thank you very helpful
"Great, now there are no more errors like yesterday. Thank you admin."
"If there is any application update info, please let me know"
"Sip.. it's good again after being updated. Very helpful for access to quality books. Suggestion, for popular books, more copies so that the queue is not too long"
"AAA, THANK YOU SO MUCH IPUSNAS TEAM! THE BOOK CAN BE DOWNLOADED AGAIN. YOU CAN READ AGAIN. AAA THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! („Å§‚âß‚ñΩ‚â¶)„Å§"
like slow or like there is a problem
Pretty okay
WL. Very helpful
"How come the borrowing error can be read, why can't it..... Hadeeeeh"
"Good, read more and read famous literary works because they can be an attraction, then if you can make a wishlist system so it's easy if you want to search again :)"
"After updating to the latest version, the app data loading is very slow. I tried deleting the data first, then I can use it again"
"Finally it can be opened after updating, good job"
"Thanks to the developer team, it's been fixed after a week of error"
You can read the book. Sorry for the 2 star rating. I give 5 stars. Big thanks ipusnas
Can't borrow books at all.
I've managed to borrow a book but can't download it.
"The latest ipusnas update can be accessed normally. Thank u min, hopefully the collection can be more complete"
"After the update, you can download the book again. Fast service. Greetings literacy"
"Thank God, the update you've been waiting for is here... Ok... Great"
"How come every time you manage to borrow a book when you want to read it, you even leave the application like that?"
"Hello iPusnas Team, is it possible? Thank you..be healthy always"
"Ok, I can, thank you"
"The application has lots of bugs, when going to read a relog book (it comes out on its own) fix it again."
"Thank you iPusnas, very useful for people who like to read, many books can be borrowed. My suggestion could be to add a feature to store books temporarily (besides loans, queues, and history). The point is that readers can save the books of their choice before borrowing them. Because usually I already borrowed 5 books but I found a new book that I wanted to borrow next. So later can make it easier."
"How come the ipusnas app now can't download, it always comes out by itself.. anyway, it's complicated for the first time..disappointed."
"Can't read, can't be downloaded, can't be opened. Please fix it... if it's good, I'll give 5 stars again"
"Hi ipusnas admin Still can't download the book we borrowed, the application is still the same from yesterday 4th, the application is not still broken, right?"
The book cannot be downloaded. Please fix it soon..
"At first it was good, there were no problems, but how come here there are frequent errors. Then I borrowed the book but couldn't download it. Yes, how do you want to read the book?"
Can't download ebook
"Yesterday, how come the application can be used, now it doesn't work. It's been borrowed but can't be downloaded, how do you want to read the book? 3 stars because it was useful."
"Come on, the force close period continues when you want to read the book"
Please fix the bug immediately... I can't download the book I've borrowed. So I can't read the book
"Sorry, min, one star first, how long will it take to fix it? The book is still not accessible. Even though it is very helpful to add insight and increase interest in reading. The opportunity to read legal books again, this is my favorite apk but it's been a few days and it still can't be accessed"

Why can't I download the book even though there's already a description to download it
Ipusnas is great. Lots of references. Cool. . Today again waiting for the optimization of the application is complete. It's sad that I can't read books in this app since this morning.
Borrowed books cannot be read (automatic log out)
"Why can't Ipusnas be opened on the tablet, even though there's still a lot of ram capacity and the quota is also smooth"
"Forgot your member ID, how do you find out again?"
"It's an error, how come it's like a state-owned national library when it's like this. Shame on the country. How do you want to be a developed country?"

Are you still having an error?
Why can't the books that have been penalized be downloaded? Please fix it...
nice
"Can't download books on Poco X3 128GB (MIUI Global 12.5.3), I've clicked download but no response, even though at the beginning it was possible but why can't now, Please cooperate so that it can be used again. Thank you"
"More frequent errors, no notification of books entering the queue list appear, sometimes books have been borrowed but cannot be downloaded, the loan period is short and there is no offer to extend. Anyway, there's a lot to fix."
Cannot download the book
"I can't download it, please fix it, I want to read it"
"You can read various books here. üòç Just a suggestion for Ipusnas, it's good to have a go to page button.. to make it easier for readers to go to certain pages... Thank you"
No wonder I can't download books since the beginning of the year. Just agitated. Hope you get well soon
Very helpful. Thank you!
Why can't I download the borrowed ebook?
"How come the country application is like this,"
"Weleh, I've been waiting for months, suddenly I can't even download it."
"Saved books can't be opened, can't be re-downloaded either. Is there a problem with Ipusnas? Or my cellphone is broken?"
"Hello min, the book in the application has been borrowed but cannot be read, when it is read it always exits the application. Why is this, please respond because this application is important for the current generation of young people"
When you want to read always exit the application continuously.
"This is not clear. Spend the budget huh? The app has an error, can't read the book. The goal is to read books. It's been launched, I can't read the book, how about it. The initial goal of the app was not achieved. Is this a corruption project? You can eat people's money. How much does it cost to make a trash app like this?"
good
Many kinds of books
Why can't I download the book I've borrowed?
"Sis, why do I want to read a book when it comes out?"
"I'm sorry, how come the book can't be read, I don't know how to do it, please tell me how to open the book!!"
OMGGGGGGGGG.I LOVE READING AND I LOVE THIS!!!!!! WHAT'S LOOKING DOWN?!! DOWNLOAD BLOCKMAN GO ADVENTURE YA. WE WILL BE MABAR.... YEMEN?!!!!
"How come it's been a few days the book can't be read, can't be downloaded and there's no solution"
"Wow, how come the book can't be downloaded all of a sudden, even though it's already been borrowed..."
"It's been a while I can't download books on my Oppo 4, but on my Vivo I can. What's wrong with Ipusnas?. I've been very happy with this application, because it helps me pursue my hobby"
Ask for the application to be repaired immediately
"Sorry, I just downloaded the application, it always comes out on its own when I want to read (give 1 star)"
I want to read a book but I can't download the book
Good and steady
"Honestly I like this application, it makes it easier for us to read books without the need to go to the library, but for some reason these days, the books I borrow can't be downloaded, I see some people are having the same problem, please fix it immediately"
"Why can't the book be downloaded? It's been borrowed but can't be downloaded. The book that was previously read suddenly had to be downloaded again, but it couldn't be downloaded. Ipusnas please don't be like this often, this application is really needed by a lot of people."
Very helpful in doing assignments
"how come mine takes a long time to enter, doesn't it? even though the signal is strong and the quota is still a lot, I also have a lot of memory, but why does it take so long to enter?"
"It took a long time to repair the application, min. It's been a few days since the app can't be used."
"I just downloaded iPusnas and tried to borrow some books, but how come after borrowing the app it comes out on its own?"
"Very disappointed, it's been almost 3 days since 05-01-2022 there has been no improvement from Ipusnas. Users can borrow but cannot download books. Shame, when other apps update features and improve app reliability; ipusnas in the new year even an error. Ipusnas admin can respond but can't fix it. It's also a shame, as an application that represents the National Library (National Library) but the application is not reliable/unusable. Please evaluate, thank you."
"It can't be read, every click goes out on its own, how can you help."
"It seems that the average complaint after being updated, yes, at first it was fine, please help immediately repair the application so that everything can run smoothly"
there are still many bugs in it
"Why can't I download the book, click download, there's no response, please fix it, right awayüôèüòä"
"After the latest update last night, all books that have been borrowed cannot be downloaded. How do you read it then????"
"Some days can't download. Pls fix it, min."
"The application is really good because almost all the books I'm looking for are in this application, but why lately the books can't be opened even though they have been borrowed."
"Is there a change in the system for borrowing books? I tried to borrow some books, but when I downloaded it, I couldn't even confirm the borrowing of the book. If you have confirmed the borrowing of the book, you can directly read the book but now you can't text at all."
Can't download now
"Please, I want to download the book can't. Please fix it"
"I have reinstalled it, but why can't the book I borrowed be downloaded? Please help, ipusnas team"
Why my error? I can download the book. I've uninstalled it twice :( btw this is the same user as redmi miui 12.5.2 android 11
"This is why I can't download the book, right? I have pressed download, it still doesn't work. My network is also good"
"Wow, the apk is really good, but please make the books more complete (especially for Lisa Kleypas' works hehe)"
It's really great
"Why is the application error? Even though I've downloaded the book and it's still fun to read, but it turns out that in the next few days I can't even open it and have to download it again, when I press the download button, it doesn't work. Please optimize immediately üôèüôè"
"how come I can't download it, can't I open it?? The apk comes out by itself on the Samsung A50 4/64 device"
Why can't borrowed books be read?
The book can't be downloaded
"The app is good. After the update, the book can be downloaded, but the book cannot be read. Please fix."
"I just downloaded it because I wanted to read a legal online book, but when I wanted to read the application, it kept coming out on its own. How are you? There should be additional features of any books that are ready to be read, every time you look for a book, you get a queue"
Try if the 5 star test is gone or not the comments
"Very good app, really helped me to access the books I want to read. But now there seems to be an error, because all the books I borrowed couldn't be read, even though yesterday they could still be read. Please deal with it immediately. Thank you"
"Already successfully installed, then managed to borrow a book. But it can't be read. Always exit the app automatically after click to start reading...thank you"
"It's really good, even though I like errors because it can't be downloaded huhu so I can't read"
My suggestion is to give it a dark mode so you can read longer. Thank you
"Please fix the bug, I can't download the book"
great
Why does the download button only work after clicking borrow?
"It's been a long time since I opened this app when I had a baby. This is one of my favorite applications that I recommend to many people. But why is it that after downloading it can't be read right away? There's even a download description, but I can't click it. Do you change the system now or is it just mine that has an error? Info please. Thank you"
"Overall it's okay, but now my account is weird, yes, a few days ago I borrowed a book and I downloaded it and I've already read it, but after one day in the future, the book from the loan has to be downloaded again, then I clicked on download, I can't So, even though the return time is 3 days away, how come you really need that book"
"The ipusnas application cannot download books on Redmi 10 5G (8G, 128G, android 11, MIUI 12.5) if you press the download button, there is no response, sometimes it crashes. Even though my internet is running smoothly without any problems, the RAM and memory of the cellphone are still relieved. Please follow up immediately. Thank you."
"Very useful for those who are just starting the hobby of reading because the book is not just that."" There are many versions of the book that are served by this application and add a very broad insight in my opinion."
"Why can't the book I borrow suddenly be opened even though it was downloaded a few days ago? My network is smooth but I still can't read the book, I'm only told to download the book and the borrowing time is still quite long. Please respond"
Who am I
"The apk is really good, it also helps for the research process. But since it was updated, why can't I open the downloaded book. Even out the apk. Even though this still really needs the book"
"After the update, why is it that every time I borrow a book I can't always download it for reading, even though before it was normal, it was just a problem scrolling with bookmarks"
"Why does the app often error when it comes out when you want to read the book? I've been trying all day, via wifi or cellular data."
"A very useful application, the readings available are quite complete and of course legal. Oh yeah, if I may give you a suggestion for the book return feature, it's better not to wait 1√ó24 hours, because sometimes when you meet a book that doesn't suit your taste, you want to return it but you can't, and at that time there were other people waiting in line too."
"My advice is to add school textbooks to all curricula, sir. If you add them, it will definitely make online learning easier and schools where there are not enough textbooks can be helped. There are so many serious bugs, I can't download the book."
"I just downloaded iPusnas again, and the problem is the same, it takes too long to login! Even though the network is good, opening social media is also smooth, there are no problems. But, why does it take so long to log in to iPusnas?"
"Good, can be used as a reading reference or as a source for doing assignments"
Why after the update.. My loan book had to be re-downloaded and it was difficult to open. Explanation please? I really like this app though. If it is fixed I will give
"Please, the one who gave the star, not 5 stars.. I know it's your right, but can you just give 5 stars.. Why do you have to queue? the name is also a library, 5 stars for this nation's application.. so that Indonesia is more advancedüôè Sorry for my selfishness"
nice
"It's a good application and very useful, my advice, try to make an application that can open files/books more than 1 book (especially applications on PC), so it's better when you want to read while comparing references, you don't have to go back and forth to open the file. Thanks"
"It's hard to do assignments, can't copy and paste"
Is the application still error? I click search it doesn't show up
"The app is good but why since this afternoon, my book search feature is not working. Every time I search for a book title or author, nothing comes up. Even though I used to believe the book was available"
"Great, this app can be an online library. So no need to go to the library anymore. It's just that sometimes it takes too long to load, whether it's the server or something. Then, if possible, the UI can be improved again so that it is pleasing to the eye. And one more thing, my advice is to buy more e-books from several authors, especially books that are borrowed a lot so that all Indonesian citizens can read the book for free üôè"
"Very helpful for me, thank you ipusnas."
"Very helpful everywhere, especially on this day wkwk"
good
So far so good. There is either added a favorite book feature or a book you want to borrow later. So that we don't lose the book we want to read even though it hasn't been downloaded. Sometimes I forget what books I want to read because I haven't downloaded it yet and there is no list of books I want to read.
"good, really like the app but if I may suggest, can the books be made unlimited so we don't have to queue? I'm tired of queuing for a long time but I can't get it, later if I read illegally I'll read pirated ones, please, thank you."
This is an error... I can't enter my email. I can't even login via fb.
"In the future, it may be possible to provide a read aloud feature and a dark theme."
"There are a lot of books, it's neat, just read it. But why do I want to log in ""please wait"" and continue, it's been more than half an hour even though the signal is stable, the quota is still a lot. I wonder why?"
"It's good, only often times the book you want to read is in use so you have to queue"
I really like it... Very helpful for those who like to read books. It is recommended to add the wishlist book feature because the allotment to borrow 5 books a day is not enough . Same homepage please more personalized. Thank you
Very useful
The time in the queue then si
"the application is very helpful, there are many books that I am looking for and all of them are in this ipusnas application. steadyüî•üî•"
Mantaff
"Please add a book with a biofouling theme, please."
Lots of good reading books and can be read offline
"The title of the book I wanted to borrow when I opened it, the contents of another book came out. Edit: The title of the book is ""Practical Guidelines: Success in Reaching Domestic and Foreign Scholarships"""
"Sis, why can't I open ipusnas now when the quota runs out üòÇ how long ago it still works, as long as you have downloaded the loan üôè"
This application state a lot of bugs :)
"Thank God, I have used the Ipusnas application, but when I want to open the password book, I can't open it, is there any help changing the password, thanks."
"Very useful....request for books on mechanical engineering, please....and the books continue to be reproduced, especially books that have just been released this year or 2, 3 years ago were added to this ipusnas so that the knowledge gained will also continue to follow growing with the times"
Very helpful for my child in learning all aspects of the lesson
"useful, but there are still many bugs"
"The books are few, yes, I queued for months for several popular books, I didn't get any, even though I often waited for Ipusnas. What's more, it seems that the notification of an available book doesn't appear in the pop up, so when you go to war, you don't get a book, you just don't get it :(( please increase the number, sis."
Why can't I borrow a book? even though I haven't borrowed a book at all for 2 days. There is a notification that I have reached the maximum limit of borrowing when I want to borrow a book.
Why have you only just found the iPusnas apk now?
"very useful, thank you iPusnas, make the nation enthusiastic about literacy"
"All borrowed books, when opened immediately autoclose. Please pay attention to fix it immediately. Greetings literacy"
"Previously I complained and gave 2 stars because of the error problem in logging in. But lately I really like reading at Ipusnas, apart from lots of fun books, the facilities are also good."
"I haven't been able to borrow a book, how to do it and I will increase the rating if I can borrow it"
"It's good, I hope there is a book request feature so that the contents of books from Ipusnas can better adapt to the needs of the community, especially students who need references for thesis"
I want to ask why when I want to enter the application there is always an error and the book I borrow cannot be read?
"This is cool, lots of good books too. Maybe it will be improved again."
"Sorry, this is the application, don't make it difficult, feel sorry for people who really want to open the application and use it. With that, I ask for help from the administrators of this application so that they are allowed to use it. Thank you"
"Hello min, I want to log in using my Facebook account but I can't write the login is disabled, how come I can't borrow books"
Good but buggy
"Wow, what a cool app"
Very nice
"Good, the book is quite complete. But too often ask for updates"
The collection is large and quite complete. But please provide the screenshot feature of the application (such as the webtoon app). By limiting the number of screenshots to avoid piracy.
"I suddenly logged out myself as a result I had to log back in. After I logged back in, it turned out that all the books I borrowed weren't on the borrowing shelf. When I tried to borrow it again, I was asked to verify my email. While in my email there is no message from ipusnas. So what's the solution?"
"Why can't we borrow even though we have registered using this email, it's not helping but making it difficult"
"For book returns, there should be no need to wait 1x24 hours, so that the queue does not pile up."
"Hello admin I've been using ipusnas since 2020, but lately what I've observed is that the stock of ipusnas e-books is not sufficient for the needs of the wider community because often the books that you want to borrow are not available. Therefore, please increase the stock, min, I think the main purpose of Ipusnas to provide literacy facilities is almost fulfilled, it's just that the stock of books is not adequate"
Ugly app
"I'll give you 3 first.. just take a look, why aren't there new books Ô∏è"
"For the developer team, please fix the book reading page, every time I scroll down, my cellphone has epilepsy. Please fix soon"
"I can't borrow an application book that always comes out, even though I have verified my email? It's urgent I want to do a task"
"Now it's okay üëç The search has also been fixed üëç The books are also quite complete üòç My input is mmm, you can add some books so that the queue won't be long"
"Please, increase the stock of books. Every time you want to read a book you have to queue first, and that's very often"
"Great, Hopefully with this application Indonesia will become a country that has a high interest in reading so that advanced Indonesia can be realized"
Add popular book recommendation menu
"Wow, it's really hard to borrow, the force close application is muluuuu, please fix the feature, please, I hope it's really good when I try it zonkk"
"If you want to read a joint book, it's true, you can't registration takes one hour, eh instead"
Why is it so difficult to login?
"Very cool. Really like this application, it provides easy access to books. In accordance with technological developments."
frequent errors
Why does it always come out when I want to read a book? Please fix me..
Very useful application..thank you.thank you ipusnas
Not bad.. The app is really good :)
ok
Thank you because my previous complaint was fixed quickly
"Can't login. Already using the correct email and password, still can't login. Also using a fb account can't log in"
Good app for people who love to read
The app is great
"Please add the Kopassus book for Indonesia, I want to read it!!!"
"the application is good, it's just that reading is not comfortable, please fix it again, I'll give it 5 stars"
"Sorry, I want to report if I don't understand this application, I download it just because my teacher told me to practice ICT assignments."
"Frankly, I prefer the look of the former Ipusnas, there are pages as well as bookmarks"
"very useful, the collection of books is expanded, the application is updated to make it easier to use, add the features of my favorite book"
I can't download the app and it keeps getting errors. Is the app crashing or what?
"The ipusnas application really helps me in reading novels. Cultivating my interest in reading during the pandemic too, is definitely very useful for me. Thank you."
"It's good, but I hope the book collections are added again. Thank you"
"Wow, I'm so glad the admin is responsive and responsive. Thank God I was able to borrow the Dairy Product Property and Technology book. Thank you very much ipusnas For those who want to download, no need to hesitate, just download it right away. The application is easy to use. Just like we are reading a book in the library. Very helpful with this application. We can read the books we want online (e-books) & legally. Especially when you're looking for lots of references for assignments, so you can save on expenses."
I really like ipusnas
A very helpful application for those who are thirsty for knowledge
Okay. Now good. But please multiply the old linguistic books. Because it's hard to find üòÇ
good to be able to educate the nation's children
"Permission to enter, min.... If you can provide the audio. So, apart from being able to read, we can also listen to stories from the audio features. thanks"
"The apk is good for insight, it's just that reading is not good, isn't it like in the novel Apk, please fix it again, I like this apk. Thank you"
"The display is too small, it's hard to read."
There are still many book titles that are not found in this application
"At first I was really excited that there was a list of some books that I wanted to read, but when I wanted to borrow, I had to verify my email, I waited for the verification email to not come in, I tried to leave my account when I wanted to re-enter the email not yet registered, please fix the system again, min"
Have you deactivated comments on books? Fail fail keep on
"For the National Library, your place is made into a field that you can take pictures of with the volume and power buttons, your old version that can be used makes it that way. Unreasonable queues and even those of us who wanted to read couldn't. The centipede-brain businessman repatriated and borrowed in a devil-like motion. I hope Queue is where we can wait our turn, everyone has the right to read. Because books are windows of knowledge, not windows of businessmen with centipede brains."
I give it a 3 star rating because the apk is quite complete and the book I'm looking for is on Ipusna. A little suggestion to provide mobile mode or reading mode for users because scrolling down makes my eyes a bit sore. Thank you
"Permission to provide input, as to how to borrow if possible, do not limit it because sometimes those who want to read books and look for references for assignments like to queue, and the queue itself is sometimes very large and long. Please follow up"
"Thanks developer who made this application. This application helps people who want to read books. My advice is yes, hopefully in the future there will be more books in this apk. Then I'm sorry I want to say that the book queue system in this apk is not good, it should be when we borrow a book there will be time when we can receive the book. Well, this is actually a fight, once someone has returned it, you have to hurry and grab it. Please in the future there will be time for the queue to be clear!!. Thank you so much. Greetings literacy"
"Those who like to read really need to have this application. Reading is definitely a choice. It's neat. There are also many famous writers. The key is to be patient in line if the book you want to borrow is still empty. If possible, the loan period can be extended. So a week or so so I don't rush to read it. Right, sometimes you can't read it right away and finish it at one time because of your daily busy life."
"The appearance of the application is impressive. It is necessary to add a bookmark button or the like to the list of book titles that appear (not in books that have been borrowed) that function as a personal collection tag, so that when there is time to read it can be borrowed or it can also be used as a reference for further reading recommendations."
"I've uninstalled this app, when I installed it again I couldn't log in. He said to deactivate the account, please explain so I can log back in?"
"A very good application for those of us who like to read. In the future, please provide lighting settings or font models, so that they don't get tired in the eyes"
Need to read through these apps for an assignment but it doesn't help at all
Read original novels not pirated
not bad
"Min, add a word search feature in the book to make it easier to find material."
"The appearance has been upgraded, so that it is more fresh. Book stock is also increased"
"Why is this, yesterday it was fine now how come it lags, even though there is a quota. Even though this is really good, but if this continues, how do you want to read it, please fix it again"
"Cool, the admin's question was immediately answered but the app bug on the PC still hasn't been fixed. The important thing is to respond first instead of being ignored, is that right?"
y Y
"Hello, this application is very helpful and has been tolerable. However, sometimes the queue for books that are in demand can be in thousands and run out even though it has only been available for 1 minute in the notification. Is it possible to limit the number of times it can be borrowed? A maximum of 2x borrowing and must be returned and borrowed by someone else before it can be borrowed again, for example? Then, for notifications to appear without having to open the app first? Request more types of books, magazines, and newspapers too. thnks before."
"Assalamualaikum, permission to ask, how come I can't login to Ipusnas using email and FB, even though I've logged in before but suddenly have to log in again?üôè"
Online library. Very useful app
"The way to read the ebook must be borrowed first. When you want to borrow, you can't. Complicated But thank you for trying to make the ebook application"
"Already logged in I was asked to verify email, but no email was sent or received, I just want to borrow a book, it's complicated"
"Why after I borrow a book I want to read the book when I go out by myself? Thank you, Min, for replying, but Alhamdulillah, now I can do it, I uninstalled it and then I installed it again, so I can. I want to complain, how come there are missing (non-existent) pages in one of the books I borrowed. The title of the book is social science and basic culture by Elly M. Setiadi, from pages 112-150 not available"
It's hard to log in from September why is thisü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
"Just downloaded but, it's really good. I like it because it can reduce the purchase of pirated books. There are people who are free, why buy pirated books. Kerennnnn"
"Very happy with the application. Most of the books I want to read are all available, Ipusnas later please add the drowning girls too so I can borrow them all the best for Ipusnas..!"
"Thank God I found this application, the spirit of reading is on again üòç"
"Why do people just want to read asking for access to photos, media and files on their device? Danger !!!"
Incomplete üôèüèº
"Very satisfied with the online reading, making it easier for us to read."
"Can you change the system from borrowing and queuing to borrowing, the problem is that it takes too long to just queue for 1 book"
Cultivate reading
I like
"hello min! I want to ask, I want to borrow a book, why does it say I have to register for an email first? I've tried over and over again, how come it doesn't work?"
Very useful. Science is the window to the world. Thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"add a feature to enter the number of the intended page and a feature for fast scrolling because I feel annoyed having to scroll manually until the middle of the book, especially if the book has 300-1000 pages it can break my finger. Add a list of favorite books too. Please my opinion be realized as soon as possible in the next update"
"Sorry, bro, why can't I verify my account. Please help"
Why can't I borrow a book? Only asked for verification in the email but there is no email inbox
"give 2 stars first. I was told to verify the email but the verification notification doesn't exist even though the email is correct, I've looked at the inbox and the spam box isn't there either"
"If something is complicated, why make it easy... To read a book, how come it's really difficult in this application.. Ask for registration, after that, password, verification of email that never appears in email... How do you want to educate the nation's life like this ....because to be smart just want to read RIBET."
"Min, please fix the application because when I want to read it takes a long time to load"
Want to read queue first. not cool
"I gave 4 stars but why when I borrowed the book, they said they haven't verified the email, they were told to check the box, but I've checked again, how come it's not there."
"thank you ipusnas for making it easier for me to read books and i beg ipusnas to increase the collection of history books, thank you‚ù§"
"This apk is good, lots of good free books. But I don't like it, why do I often find it difficult to search or see what has been downloaded to read? Not to mention logging out suddenly, it's not clear."
"Please help, why can't I borrow books in this application, even though I have registered and logged in using the original account, but still can't borrow"
"Please fix the login problem, I have tried over and over again until 2x reinstall the application. Very troublesome. Every login is always stuck For my internet connection is safe and smooth, but still can't login"
"I want to read a book but I have to log in to my account, I've logged in with my email account but I'm lagging, I have to log in again but I can't :)"
"Good morning, literacy greetings. Do you want to ask, is Ipusnas in error or not on November 25th? Because my signal is safe if I open another app. But when I open the Ipusnas app, the signal immediately goes down. I'm afraid it turns out that my cellphone has an error, finally I try to delete the app and reinstall it. It's still the same. I've restarted the cellphone, it's still the same"
"It's actually good. Very helpful in finding reference books or just reading novels. But please, please increase the collection, as well as improve the system. It takes a very long time to open, finally it doesn't work even though the network is okay."
Why has it been crashing a lot lately...
How come the apk is lagging....huft...pdhl why don't you want to read+ for assignments?
"Oh my gosh, why is it so slow now. To open book descriptions and reviews, you have to wait up to 3 minutes I would like to suggest, make a reading mode for the night, so your eyes don't hurt üôè Thank you"
How come I can't log in?
"How does the intention to read go up, just want to enter, it's really slow, waiting for 10 minutes can't be done"
"The application still has many bugs, the variety of books is still minimal."
"Why can't it be opened, huh?"
"It's really nice to be able to read free books, let's add to the collection"
Slow to lag book collection when I try to add it again
Just tried it for the first time on the recommendation of a literacy friend. If it's good I'll add one more star. Please add more translated novels too.
"Very good, I really like this application"
after updating it's even more laggy.. please fix it
"Is there any problem with Ipisnas? How come my account goes back to the beginning again and all the books in my library disappear even though I just borrowed it I keep re-logging in using email, I can't"
why when i want to borrow a book at pusnas but i always fail. and it came out saying that my account was asked to verify first via an email inbox. while in my email there is no incoming message from pusnas. how is that?
good apk but often error
You still can't
"This application is very helpful in every way, highly recommended for students. Just please insert a feature to save reading limits and be able to mark important things"
"I give it 5 stars, because I really like using this application to read ebooks legally. Hopefully in the future, the collection of books here will be more complete."
"Actually I was very helped because of this application. Reading is so much easier. However, lately when I want to open an application / search for a book title / open a bookshelf / etc. it takes a very long time to load. Even though my internet is normal. Please fix soon."
"This application deserves 5 stars. The book collection is gradually getting better. However, my suggestions as an iPusnas reader: (1) Usually loading applications takes a long time to open the first time the application is opened. Even though my network is good. (2) It would be nice if we were given the order of queuing, so as not to fight over the ebook with others. (3) It would be nice if notifications -books that were already available- appeared above the notification bar."
"I want to read and the connection continues to fail, I try to use WiFi or cellular data but it still fails, please fix it."
Old people are good to enter
Why do you like errors?
"I want to login to Facebook but why is it taking so long, he says please wait, how long are you going to wait?????"
"Even though the signal is already 5G, the list is really slow"
"This app is really good. But why can't I borrow a book? Even though the email has arrived, the pswrd is also correct."
"Please fix it, I want to read the book, I was told to log in, so I logged in with my FB account, after that I was told to wait. But, why does it take so long to load? Normal apks are usually fast or at least ""a bit fast"". Please fix itüôè"
"Very good. I think iPusnas is really helpful, the advice is to make more collections of books. Thank you"
Well
I've downloaded 2 times and still can't log in
‚ù§Ô∏èüëç
"I feel very helpful with this application, there are many books that I can use as sources for doing various lecture assignments, especially practicum reports. My advice, please add a keyword search feature to the book we are reading/opening to make it easier and speed up the process of finding the material we need. In addition, I give permission to suggest a quota for borrowing books for more than 5 per day, so that we as readers are more flexible."
"iPusnas is indeed good but there are some drawbacks that I don't like. For example, before borrowing, you can't see the contents of the book (unlike the Smart Library even though it's only a few pages) so you have to borrow to find out the contents of the book and sometimes the borrowed book doesn't match your expectations. In addition, they also cannot know how many pages in the book will be borrowed. Also add 'read later' or something like that so you can save books you want to read but haven't had time to borrow."
"Actually the references are good, but please make more copies I've been waiting from semester 1 until I'm writing my thesis and it's always running out"
"There are only a few discussions about persons with disabilities and the law on persons with disabilities does not suggest that there should be more discussions about persons with disabilities to make it easier for students to find information, thank you"
"How will interest in reading go up? Making an application that should make it easier for us to read is actually making it complicated. The book collection is also incomplete, plus if you want to read a book, you will have to log in again. It's as hard as it is. Just give one star because you really deserve one star."
"For now it is better than before, thank you admin for the very fast response in responding to problems from users"
"The application is very useful, but why do you often get errors, connection problems?? Pdhl my internet is stable bro."
Cannot open books that have been borrowed.
"It's good for reading novels. But something is missing, please add a list feature so that if there are e-books you want to read but there are still unfinished ones, so you don't need to borrow them to add them to the list first."
I'm sorry for the one who had the idea for this application
"This ipusnas application is very helpful but it would be nice if a forum was provided for discussions about books and studying together to discuss 1 or more books, not only book recommendations."
"It's very easy to read the book you are interested in, without having to buy it"
Like.
"How come I can't login, huh? Since then 'please wait' continues"
Highly recommended if you want to read a book.
Now it's not slow anymore... Thank you for the update
Thank you I hope there will be more collections.
"It's a good application so you can get books that can't afford it, given 4 days to read it, even though you have to queue first but overall it's good"
The application is super duper
Knowledge warehouse
"good, but please add more fantasy genre novels, especially all novels by tere liye"
"I want to complain, before logging in to the account was smooth, why is it now starting to get an error and I can't log in?"
"I am very grateful to the government and parties who contributed to the creation of this application. My hope is that the number of copies of the book will be increased, especially for books that have a lot of interest. Then for the appearance and features of the application, hopefully it will be further improved to make it easier and more comfortable for readers."
Difficult to log in
Good let's develop again
"Min.. There are books by the late. Prof. Dr. H. Aziz Fachrurrazi, MA. dong.. continue the book Models of Teaching, Learning Theories and other books. I'll give a lot of stars later if the books I'm looking for are already there."
Waiting to get my turn to read the book is a long time
"Hi, can the 'private notes' feature be improved? I once wrote in personal notes, but the notes were not saved, even though I was online with an adequate network. Thank you, hopefully the application will be better in the future."
"Very helpful as a learning support... Please fix it when the book is available, there's a notification like that"
Very good this app
"Good, very helpful for educating the nation's children"
Please complete the features
Please increase the number of copies for books that have a lot of fans so you don't have to wait long
good
"please add books about encyclopedias and biographies of external figures, I really like reading both üôèüèª"
Thank you for loading this application. Thank you
"It's complicated, if you want to read it, you have to notify the account again. It's like you want to disburse aid funds but you miss a lot of posts. Each post is cut. No wonder not smart smart"
"Very cool, there are many collections of useful books, very helpful for those who like to read."
"It's so bad now, every time I borrow a book, I keep repeating nothing, but I can't open it"
"Why is this Pusnas? I've been looking for a book for a long time, ""Search results not found"" I'm really annoyed (edit) After one year I reviewed Ipusnas, I'm back again, just reinstalled but just wanted to use the tbtb apk it came out on its own, it's hard to read books too the entry is always there with the message ""preparing the book"" waiting for 15 minutes without opening the book. Why?"
"Anyone who wants to read a book suddenly gets a bug? How about not making a bug, okay?"
"So far I'm comfortable with the app, because it helps me read books without having to buy them, but it's still legal. My suggestion is that the books that appear on the homepage are in accordance with the genre of the books that have been borrowed. Then, maybe a notification if a book is available can be in the notification column, sometimes I have to open and close the application to check the queue."
"Version 1.5.1 on my device, Redmi 9C, when I want to read a book, it force closes or exits itself. Please fix it. Edit: it turns out that the problem is in the application access permissions, bro. After I allow storage access, Ipusnas can be used normally."
"Now the Ipusnas application is very good compared to the past, there are no problems when logging in to the account‚ú®"
Nice and helpful
"MasyaAllah tabarakallah... This application is very useful, especially for those of me who like to read but don't have enough money to buy books"
"Why can't I borrow the book 'Email saka Jakarta', bro?"
"Cool, keep on improvising"
"Can you add a favorite menu or not? Or add a button to enter the book you want to read. So when you're scrolling, there's a book you want to read, keep it first, don't borrow it right away because the borrowing time is only 5 days . Because the previous book has not been finished reading, so if you find a good book, keep it first. To make it easier for readers to read what's next. Suggestion. Hope you understand my advice."
"Arrived today a page of a book that I borrowed from the bank. I've returned it, borrowed it again but it's still up. Anyone know where the problem is?"
I can't register
"Great, very useful"
"Very useful, thank you ipulnas"
More friendly with the times
There are some books that do not have these pages being difficult to quote. Please fix

"Ipusnas is very useful for us, especially like now when it's still a pandemic"
"really like iPusnas!! It's been 2 years I read legal books here, it's really fun!. Thank you iPusnas <3"
Very long loading.
I read it but why did it disappear in three days
"Download this Apk because you want to read a legal book by Tere Liye, but the stock is limited, where there is a double title."
"Overall it's a good application, really helpful for us students. Maybe there is a little suggestion, in the detailed information on the book, please include the category of the book, so that it is easier for us to find similar books."
"Actually, it's pretty good, but there are still errors when looking for or borrowing the book. Hopefully it can be even better. And recently, when I opened the book, it was cool to leave the application. Hopefully it can be fixed."
I can not login
Free borrowing books The method is easy and not complicated Thank you iPusnasüôè
"Sorry, this is just my input 1. The UI really needs to be fixed 2. The scrolling isn't smooth and the title/cover display and arrangement are very bad, 3. The display looks like it refreshes every time we scroll down, the search mode and categories are disappointing please increase 4. There is no specific filter to make it easier, also add a hashtag I appreciate even though the reading is incomplete it is still understandable but because this is officially owned by the government I am very hemmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"
"the application likes tbtb problems even though the signal is good :(( but when i open ipusnas it immediately loads for a long time, then sometimes the refresh time also doesn't work :(( even though it's good to be able to read free books with legall, but the application is not smooth huhu"
"So that the reading culture will be higher in Indonesia, especially Aceh"
"I want to give input, please so that a floating notification can appear. So that if you queue for a book, the notification can appear even though you are not opening the application. New input, I hope there is an 'add to reading list' feature. Because sometimes when I scroll through Ipusnas I often find good books, but I still have other books that I haven't finished reading. If there is a reading list, I can easily find the book I want to read again."
"Can't be accessed using Facebook. If you use email, you have to register first, it seems, but there is no registration form"
"How come the error can't login, can it help?"
nice
"The application is really good for me, who often reads here, but the drawback is that there is no dark mode, the background is white so it makes your eyes tired quickly, my advice if you can use a black background or dark mode."
The apk cannot be opened. Please hold on. I don't know when it can be opened even though it's already in sync with the FB account.
"This application really helps me, to read whenever and wherever, and the collection of books is quite large, IS THE BEST anyway. I hope this can increase the interest in reading today's children who are lazy to hold books (Amiinnn). Recommended App for those who want to add insight!!!!! Btw suggestions for developers. If possible, the NYT version of the best-selling books are available at Ipusnas, right?"
"This one's cool. Great, develop again so that it will be better in the future"
"The application is good, I love reading more. Please add more applications that provide educational books and novels like this. It's just that it's really difficult to register."
So much fun
The application is very good. I can read books easily and practically. And there's a book that I've been looking for everywhere but can't find it. But in this application there is and is very helpful. Thank you ipusnas
"Very good application, can read loan books offline. That's the main advantage of this application, the collection isn't complete, maybe, because there are many books that have a long queue"
Haven't tried it yet
"Actually, this ipusnas app is really good. Can be borrowed, legal, and can be withdrawn automatically within a few days. There are only suggestions: 1. Add audio mode so that our blind friends can also read. 2. Books that appear on the homepage look like books that are less interesting in terms of the themes we like. 3. I looked for Harry Potter's book but couldn't find it. Is it not here yet? I really like harry potter though huhu"
I give 5 even if you try
"Hey hey hey my name is Keshia, I downloaded the app, it's good, it's good! So I knew a story book and when the teacher asked me to read a story I read it here. Poko is really good! You must download this app! üòäüíó"
Very nice. If you can make an ebook feature.
Why can't I enter?
"The application is good. Thank you to the National Library for encouraging people to love reading more. A little advice, if the queuing system is made like a booking, I think it's fairer. So there will be a notification, for example, there is no confirmation of the loan in a few hours (for example), then it will be forfeited and then sent to the next borrower. I feel sorry for those who never got it, so that we can train the culture of queuing discipline and not grabbing each other."
So happy to have found this app
Wow
"Frequent errors, incomplete features. The rest is greatüëçüèª"
Still minimal features. My suggestion is to add a bookmark feature which can mark the books that we will read later. So you don't have to bother scrolling and typing in search. thanks.
Beneficial
"I'm looking for a book on comparative religion, isn't it?"
"The application is good and interesting... Suggestions: 1 Expand the collection. 2 Several times I have come across a book which has the direction/form of a scientific paper (it is better to classify it as a scientific work than a book, it is a bit difficult for the layman to understand). 3. Please add a search option by page to make it easier for readers 4. Please add an option to view book reviews from previous readers. Thank you"
Good app very helpfulüëç
I really like the application for those who have limitations to buy books
Why can't I login to the app?
"Good, great collection. Suggestions, add to the collection for the latest & popular books, and improvements to the book search feature."
"Very useful, even though sometimes it's an error"
Cool experience.. Keep improving
Why can't I register using email? Guess why?
"Makes it easy to read books, because the library is far from home"
Very good for reading
Why are there no books on the Little House series by Laura Ingals Wilder and the Harry Potter series?
"Good, I can borrow some books I like"
"Pretty good, but the book has a lot of queues, it's a long wait"
"Why is it so hard to log in, even though I've been waiting for a long time but it's not opening, please check again"
"This application is very helpful for me who wants to read but is limited in cost. There is also a lot of reading material here, it's just a matter of choosing what you want. But maybe if there is a list of books to be read, it will be very helpful because sometimes you don't have time to borrow and forget not to write down the title of the book and when you want to find it is a bit difficult. Thank you"
"Please fix the bug. If you have borrowed it and want to download it, it always comes out by itself by force. Please fix it soon. Because it's been like this many times since 2020.‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Thank you. because we have provided this apk, we no longer need to go to the library to read, just download this apk, we can add insight by reading the Apk, really recommendedüëç"
Okay
"Why doesn't dark mode work? To update new books, please activate more. Thank you for providing this service ‚ù§"
"Why do you want to borrow a book, min, not registered with Ipusnas, please choose, input password always appears, password is not filed, why is that, min??"
"I've had the same comment, I don't know where the problem is, because of the signal (actually the signal is always slow when I open this app but when I open another app the signal is fast) or maybe the app on my cellphone has an error. I still can't write a comment in the column, it always fails. This is the umpteenth time. For books that I read, there is always no progress, even though I have read quite a number of books. May I know why?"
"There are so many books available here, it's a shame if you download it"
"Wow, it's amazing that Mimin always talks. Admin spirit. Next, increase admin salary"
Very helpful
Many book lists are not available when you want to borrow.
Why do you keep on maintaining?
request my favorite feature? Thank you
"Hello ipusnas admin, why is this every time I want to open a book it keeps on force closing? Even though my cellphone is already android 9. Please respond!"
disappointed can't log in
"Very helpful, especially for students, students, teachers and lecturers."
"It's a great place to read, isn't it?"
"JUST SUGGESTIONS, IF ANYONE LOANS A BOOK, THEY ARE GIVEN A TIME LEADING SO THE OTHERS CAN GET TO READ, IF YOU ARE LATE IN RETURNING A FINE, YOU'RE TIRED OF WAITING WHICH IS NOT SURE!!!!"
The book is incomplete :)
"How come the book runs out so fast, queue again"
"The book collection is decent, needs improvement for the way to find the books"
"I thought you could use the register, instead you queued and then force closed again"
Excellent
"I like errors.. but it's a good book.. I like to read TEMPO the most, hopefully there will be more collections"
Lots of books üëç
Why can't my app login even though the email is correctüò≠üò≠üò≠
"Not fast enough to borrow a fairly large book, the rest is good"
Very nice
A digital library that can meet the needs of literacy and academics.
Can't login fb. Use email somehow. How is the list. There's never been a local application right.
"hello min! there is a little advice from me. In the future, it may be possible to add a favorite book feature!. So, when you find an interesting book but don't have time to read it, you can add it to your favorites list, so you don't have to bother looking for the book again. That's all my advice, hopefully it can be realized, hehe. thanks in advance!! <3"
"Every time I open it, I want to read a book to learn, it comes out automatically. Even though my network is good, please fix it!!!"
"Please, those who bt this application, improve it more. It's a very good book. I'm borrowing a new book, 3 days after I haven't finished reading it's gone on my list. And can't be opened again."
"good, for those who like to read books can download this"
Please fix it so I can borrow again
"Really cool app! I really like recommending this application to my friends because it is a digital reading application with a complete collection of reading books! Ipusnas also always adds to its collection of reading books. In my opinion, this application is very comfortable to read. From the appearance, the features are also good to use. For suggestions, maybe add the latest research journals of Indonesian students. Same rich books on scientific studies plus (example: books on extensive reading, etc.)"
At least you can only borrow +5 books in a day. Hahaha
Very nice
The book selection is quite complete. Please increase the number of Teras Philosophy books!!! Because I've been queuing for over a year and never got it.
"Hopefully always improve the service, thanks"
"Synopsis and reviews from readers do not appear, even though they are an important part of deciding which book to borrow."
Recommendations for filling free time by reading books
"At iPusnas, there are many students' fav books, the number of copies is still not sufficient, it can be seen from the thousands of waiting queues. My suggestion is that the number of copies can reach thousands/millions, looking at the data on the number of students at Dikti. Popular fiction and non-fiction that are popular with the Indonesian people are also reproduced, so that in the future the reading movement can be comprehensive throughout Indonesia and there is an application update that can automatically return borrowed copies if the account is observed to be inactive for some time. @gogonokicha"
"Really good, but why can't I login? I've tried to download this app several times, but from last year until today I can't get in. What to do?"
Thank you for the useful space provided ‚ù§Ô∏è
Okay
The loan time is not long
Why did I change my password??
"It's interesting, if I may give advice, add a barrier feature. So when I read it, I was already on page 200, I wanted to break and continue, I didn't start from the beginning and I didn't scroll again. Thank you continued success"
"Almost complete, everything you want to look for is there. But the queue, you have to be patient, you never get it, always go first. Moreover, a new book has just been published, there are not too many copies, there are already thousands of people queuing up, wow, it's really great to wait."
"can ipusnas be made copies of the book? like the apk next door with many copies of the book. ipusnas types of books are more complete, but there are only a few copies."
"Why are research books rare? Like Marcel Mauss' ""Giving"". How can citizens be smart, just fill out the state library in checkbooks. bad."
Many references
Can't login
Quite helpful for reference needs
ok
Ô∏è
"It helped me a lot, but it would be even better if the notification feature could appear in the phone's status bar. So you know that the book in the queue that we want to borrow has already been returned"
"Useful application I am happy with this application. Lots of good books. If you can get popular books, don't wait long in line. Because I always queue for that book. I think the app is good."
Very nice
Overall is good
"Useful applications, making it easier for us to find and read the books we need"
"Thank God the application brings insight, knowledge and my imagination to see the world through the Book window"
"really like using ipusnas~ want to give a suggestion, can you add a feature to the list of books you want to read? I think it will be very useful for readers who want to read other books but still have unfinished book loans. So the book is added to the reading list without having to take notes or screenshot the title of the book... Thank you"
"The ebook collection is very diverse, and there are many choices of book collections. Hopefully there will be an online membership card service soon. Thank you National Library for providing a very useful application."
"Very cool, the application is very polite For suggestions: more books, both about philosophy, technology, and all kinds of books"
"In my opinion, it's made easier, from logging in, to the limitless book borrowing limit, and other features."
"When I want to read a book, why does it take so long, there is an inscription PLEASE WAIT it doesn't end up reading it, please help"
"sorry, how do you log in, how come the one who made the cm apk has this capability, but the Indonesian library is digital ""he said"""
Borrowed a book but can't read it
Good app
What do you like?
"This application is already cool, but please improve the appearance of the application to make it more lively and colorful."
"The latest display of iPusnas is really cool. Thank you. However, I'm having trouble finding the bookmarks menu."
"It's good, complete + legal. Suggestion: the notification of the availability of the queued book, try to appear on the cellphone notification, so you know that if the book can be borrowed :// it's a bit difficult, if you have to open the app first, it'll be borrowed by someone else"
"When I borrow a book, I want to open the book, the apk immediately comes out, that's how it is"
"Quite helpful, but the book collection is incomplete, min.. Please complete it if you can"
This is... That's how it's good
"Sorry, min, why every time I want to register the password is always wrong, right? Even though my email password is correctüôè"
The apk is great and has many benefits
"Min, is there an error in searching for Ipusnas? How come yesterday on my cellphone or PC I can't find books in the search box. Please fix soon. Thank you"
good
"I can't find a book like it used to, I can only download the one on the veranda... please fix it again"
Why lately the error is often ... both on windows and on android ... please fix it.
"It needs more development in the display, and please bring up the read later feature so that books that have not been read but have forgotten the title can be found again in this feature. Thank you!"
"It's been updated, how come I can't find the book, bro? When I want to search for it, it's empty, so the result is white. This is my cellphone, network or what :("
"what error is this application, I can't search, I can't have it"
Why the search is not working
The app is slow
"Is there a problem with the application? The problem is that I can't search for books, search results are not displayed, the network is also not problematic because the homepage can be refreshed. Hopefully it will be fixed soon, thank you."
Why can't I find a book? I have tried many times the results are still empty even though my internet is stable
Error sure what. Looking for a reference
Very good and very helpful but it's a shame I like to log out myself
"The application is very helpful, but errors often occur."
Very nice
"Sorry, bro, why can't the book be borrowed again? There are many books in this app that I use as thesis references, min. Because during the pandemic, ebooks are very helpful. Every time I click ""borrow"" it doesn't work... Please fix it asap üôèüôè"
"Add the animation, sir, so it's not stiff"
"Thanks for making these apps, I hope more people install them so no one reads pirated books anymore. For suggestions, please add a notification feature. So if the queued book is already available, the notification will appear and it's not too late to borrow it."
Why is the queue book notification not coming in? so late
Amazing app
Sometimes when it is opened it comes out on its own.
good
It doesn't look attractive
Are notifications still only on the app?
"Ipusnas' performance is not what it used to be. Now it's really hard to download even though the signal is stable, it's almost 100% and suddenly it's back from 0."
I repeat yes. Thank you to all those behind ipusnas. The application is very useful and I have read a lot of books in this applicationüòöüòö
There's nothing better than a reading service
"It's good, the book is also quite complete but can you please update the UI so that it's more comfortable to use"
Please give a notification from the activity and inbox so that we know if the stock of the book we are queuing for is there or a message has come in. Please help!
"Why can't I download the book now? I've clicked several times, no response. Please help"
Very useful
Why do some books have texts so close together that they are difficult to read?
"It's good, but please increase the number of books. Especially for some books that are read a lot like terrace philosophy, etc. Because every time you borrow there is always a long queue. Unless it's open every hour, check if there are still queues."
Very suitable for literacy programs
Provide an easier book search feature & fix bugs in book borrowing that often error. Thank you
Very nice
"Hi ipusnas, why now if you want to read a book that has been borrowed by the forceclose application, please help. For the title of the book, various kinds of energy and philosophy of research methodology and scientific communication. Still forceclose , but if you want to read books on Naura's world, it's not a problem."
Sufficient for my needs as a student
"Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't when used. Thank you Indonesian Library. Hope it gets better"
"great, lots of books. why doesn't ipusnas appear on android 5.1.1 playstore y min?. what is the minimum android version?"
"Hi Ipusnas admin, why is the application taking so long to load now"

"hi admin, why can't I open it... the books that are already on the bookshelf?"
Why now the application likes to come out on its own
Very good and very useful
Free and legal book app
Nice app. Very useful for reading entertainment. Hopefully there can be more collections at ipusnas.
"With iPusnas, you can read anywhere...cool..."
Thank you ipusnas for channeling my hobby even without going to the library..love
üëç
"Thank you sir, I hope that after you finish serving this apk will not be deleted and will continue to be developed by the next education minister, thank you for the current education minister, Mr. Nadim Makarim"
"It's very good, but it's just a problem that I can't borrow books again, maybe I can help you, what do you think the problem is that I can't borrow books?üôè"
"Why is it that when I borrow a book, it always shows an ""unknown error"" and can't be borrowed. Ask for help."
"I'm very happy that the book is quite complete, and you don't have to look far to find books. Hopefully, the book will be more complete and Ipusnas will continue to develop so that literacy will be more activeüòç"
"The application is good, providing a variety of books from fiction to non-fiction, from local and foreign authors legally. As long as I use this application I find it very helpful in finding good quality reading. However, after installing this application again after uninstalling, I have difficulty borrowing books. Every time I want to borrow, an ""unknown error"" always appears, even though the signal is stable and there is a quota. Please fix, thank you."
"Dear, Admin, please fix the bug again, okay? Sometimes the cover of the book with the title listed is different. And for fiction, please add more to the collection. Thank you!"
Thank you
Good for increasing literacy interest
"I will increase the star to five if Ipusnas wants to improve the search. I looked for Second Sister which was obviously there, but wasn't there. Already in popular search, it doesn't come out either. Weird. How many books have Ipusnas withdrawn, even though the books are very good. Please answer yes, because this really sucks."
nice
"Thank you very much for this app, actually, interest in reading is high but I don't have the money to buy books, so this app is really helpful"
"HUWAAA I'M SO VERY ANGRY, WHILE I'M VERY INTERESTED AT THE END OF THE STORY BUT IT'S LOVING, CAN'T I BORROW ANY BOOK AAAARGH PLEASE I WANT ANYONE I WANT TO READ A DEUCE BOOK BY KAK NETTY VIRGIANTI PLZZZ PLZZZ. EVEN ALREADY CHANGE ACCOUNT, STILL REMEMBER TO DOWNLOAD"
Why does the application often error? Sometimes looking for a book gets distracted
How come you can't borrow mind
"This app is actually very helpful. However, there are still many things that need to be improved, namely: 1. The search problem is less accurate. 2. Availability of limited stock of books, especially since online learning requires many books to be queued. 3. The application takes a long time to load and is often down."
"There is a book that has no pages. The title is ""Reviewing Literary Works with a Feminist Perspective"" by Hafid Purwono Raharjo. please help so I can write dapusüôè"
"Incomplete book. It's no longer borrowed, but it's your turn to open it to read it, instead it exits the application itself."
Very helpful and supportive
"Nice app. Suggestion, what if this application is given the ""read it"" feature later the writing is read into sound. So that those who have been unable to read for a long time can still take knowledge through sound. Look at the cellphone and it also doesn't seem to last long. Thank you"
"I've logged in, but sometimes the application takes a long time to open... Even though the network is good"
"The app is good. But still often slow in responding, frequent errors. Hopefully it can be fixed and added to the development soon."
"I've verified my email, but I still have to wait... It used to be really easy to enter Ipusnas. Now it's a long time... Why y."
Why can't it be downloaded?
"Assalamualaikum, this apk is really good but please can I register my email again, even though yesterday I registered, I continue to delete it and I want to log in again can't please give me a chance to log in again"
This app is cool
"iPusnas really helped me in doing my assignments and reading books. Free books are very helpful for readers who want to read books, but don't have the money to buy physical books. But please increase the number of books. There are many books that I want to read but the queues are long. So far the app is goodüëçüëç"
Bugs everywhere
Most bugs
Can't login
Thank you very much for your contribution to educating & facilitating access to see the world anywhere and anytime in one hand.
Really like!
It's just annoying.. I can't login.. I was given a reason to check the internet network.. Other applications are okay.
Why is it so hard to log in?

"The search for a book is difficult, it is not accurate what it looks like. When you want to borrow, you are constrained always coming out to the front page"
"Great, keep growing"
can read free books
ok
How come I can't log in?
good
It's a digital book though. Why does there have to be a queue?? Ô∏è
Pretty helpful. Hopefully the books will be more complete. From fiction to nonfiction. Thank you!
The one who gave the 1 star fix doesn't understand what knowledge is even though it's complete + delicious
"I really like this app. For people who have a hobby of reading, it will be very helpful because during this pandemic we are not all too free to go to public libraries or others, with this application we can all still read novels, books to learn foreign languages, and others. Thank you ipusnas, I hope that there will be many other translated novels in electronic form because in my opinion there are still a few."
Complicated
Why can't I login using Facebook?
üëçüëçüëç
"It's a really good application, to add insight"
"The book is incomplete. What I was looking for, mostly not there."
Like to lag
"Good, really helpful for assignments. But please increase the stock of books and the number of books, I'm having a hard time borrowing because many are out of stock. Oh yeah, just fix it, it's a bug, it's often an error, even if the network is fast"
Very good... original (:
Hopefully there will be more book collections
Reading helps me through this pandemic. Thanks iPusnas.
"¬∞ Can't login, sir. It's been since last night. When I can login. I changed the star (26.08.2021) ¬∞Since the beginning of the download until now, I can't login, Min. It's been a month 28.08.2021"
There are still many shortcomings. The supply of source books is very minimal
Hmm it's quite helpful for meü§©
Please fix the notification
"Make the right application, not the one that is difficult to operate"
"Thank you Ipusnas and the Ministry in charge, I was disappointed with this application before because it couldn't be installed on my old Ipad.. but I'm trying now it works, maybe the system has been adjusted.... Thank you again...please keep the application in the future it is compatible with all devices."

Very helpful in meeting the reading needs of the community.
"Suggestion, do top reads, for example the category of fiction, non-fiction, etc."
Very helpful Thank you üôè .
Good app
learn to be cheaper
it is difficult for users when they want to borrow books to read all full
ok
"It's good, I just hope that in the future all the books can be crossed out (highlighted) as a reminder, to remember important parts, because they can't be screenshots, so we need a TEXT MARKING FEATURE, like the color highlighter in the book"
Good... Now it doesn't come out by itself anymore on my device
"Very useful with the dynamics of the times that continue to change, hopefully our country's reading rating will get better"
Pretty good but sometimes the apk can't be opened
"The application is very helpful, it's just not user friendly where it looks a bit foreign. Unlike applications that are commonly used in general. But I also thank you because with this application, my college assignments will run smoothly."
Very nice
Keep innovating
"I'm really happy to have the ipusnas apk, I live in a remote city and it's hard to buy the books I want. Luckily there is ipusnas ‚ù§"

"The regional library in the district is closed due to the pandemic, so I can't read. Thank God there is Ipusnas, you can read free books at home. I suggest more books. It's nice to be able to access via the web too. because in the dormitory you can only open a laptop, you can't hold a cellphone. find the most convenient ebook only on ipusnas"

"The app is good, but sometimes the stock of books is limited, so you have to wait in long lines"
"Very helpful, thank you. But maybe a solution can be varied which takes too long to borrow the book but is not returned, there are some that I queued for but haven't gotten the book yet. Thank you mimin, always healthy yaa"
"I really like the iPusnas application, thank you very much for providing this application"

Very helpful
"Alhamdulillah, fine"
Difficult to get the requested reading book.
"The application is good, a large selection of books. It's just that sometimes users have difficulty borrowing books, and when reviewing books sometimes it is difficult to send comments. Please improve the application again to make it better. I hope more people read the book."
"Read a lot, learn a lot"
WL
It really helps me to find books when working on questions
The collection of books is large and quite complete. Ipurnas is really cool. Really like this one application.

How come it just comes out of the picture.. how long it takes to enter... how do you do it... is the apk damaged.. or is it Giman... please fix it.
The list button is missing. Then how to login if you can't register. Application needs to be fixed.
Just tried it might be good

"Best of the best. I really enjoy reading books at Ipusnas, the collections which are slowly starting to complete make me feel at home"
"Applications that really help students, instead of looking for illegal books, it's better at Ipusnas, I hope the book collection will increase so that book piracy can be reduced"

Okay thank you very much
"ok,"
Pretty good
"The books provided in the application are quite complete. My suggestion is that the number of books can be increased, especially for books that are popular (a lot of reading). The system might be even better, in the sense that there are no lags and other errors."
Increase the number of book collections...bravo
"Why when I want to read my Ipusnas I can't always read a book from a loan and it says ""application stopped"""
love it
why is it taking so long to update?
Thank you IPusnas. I'm reading books more and more now hehe. I hope there will be more books. The book quota has also been added hehe
"Every time I want to read a book on the loan list, I immediately say that Ipusnas has stopped! Then go out alone. Ô∏è"
"Developers, please provide a notification feature if the queue book is available, because it's a hassle having to check back and forth for the application"
"Good, but can't screenshot. In fact, if you make a report assignment, there must be an attachment to the book that is used as a reference"
"Can't login to old account. I have sent an email to verify the password change, but the link doesn't work"
Access to download the application is difficult..
"Wow, a large collection of novels and books"
Sudan tried many times but can't log in
Very helpful
"I just downloaded, then logged in, registered, but how come it says email is already in use :("
"Disappointed, isn't it like before"
"A very helpful application, and also the ""features are very good, but there is only 1 problem sometimes the application likes to crash or exit itself while reading either because of my cellphone or the application but it's really good for reading"" when you're free, that's all, thanks for the application his"
"I am new user in this app. My email is correct, but when I was going to borrow the book, there was a warning from the app that said I couldn't borrow the book because I hadn't verified my email/got an email notification from this app. So how?"
"Can't login, I've tried many times"
A good application has a large collection and also helps us make those who can't go to the library
Can't make a book search
Thank you for improving the application. I really enjoy reading moments at ipusnas.
"You can't use email, you can use FB but you still have to include a password, it's hard to borrow, can you use an application like the government's national library like this? Please justify it, just want to read it complicated, is this really from the national library? It's bad"
"How many times have you tried logging in with a different email, but the message keeps saying ""Email is already registered!"" I'm new to this application, how's the system, the developer is stupid, isn't it?!"
"I still have an error, please fix it again, the stock of books is increased and the variety of books is also increased"
"Please fix the application, I read ""all the reviews are the same as the login problem, and I also find it difficult to log in, thank you"
"Min, I have an error. I've emailed to fix it please check"
the network is stable but can't login.... can't you log in dslah
"This is how I want to read a book, How do I want to advance in Indonesia, I can't even login. Hopefully, the application can drain the emotions of the user"
"Why is this, I want to login using email but I can't, and it says your email has been registered, even though this is the first time I've installed this app and was told to try again but still can't, when I want to login using FB it takes too long to load"
"Pretty good, what needs to be improved maybe just the UI to make it more user-friendly and not confusing."
"The application likes to lag, it makes me annoyed even though the network is good so it's hard to even read"
"Hi, I really like this app, I can read novels that I can't legally buy. Excellent"
"Hey min, I want to ask why I login using email but it's always wrong, until I change my password but it's wrong, then I try to login using fb but it still says waiting for this for almost half an hour, is the service really like this?"
"""Can't retrieve data from the server and there's no DLS"" what the hell is this :( even though I've uninstalled and installed it again but it's still like this. I want to read it huhu :((( *edited, it's good hehe"
"It's really good, my only suggestion is the notification feature, please set it up, because I always don't get a slot even though I open Ipusnas every time, or the number of copies of the book is not increased for books that have a lot of reader interest, overall it's good how many useful books hopefully in the future books -Ipusnas books are getting more complete, cheers!!!"
"Fix the apk first, min, I can't open the application, I can't open the application, it's a problem when I open it and it goes back to the beginning, I can't use the potato cell phone even though it's only 26 MB, please policy I need to look for references for college"
"There is no register menu, so I can't login, if it's fixed I'll change the value. Regards"
"The last few times I opened iPusnas, it was very disappointing... Because when I wrote the title of the book in the search column, the results/search results were far from what we wrote, even the title I wrote was very, very inconsistent with the search results. Its so bad. Please fix itüôèüèª Because at first I used this app it was very helpful."
"This application is great. Many titles of books that I have not read before, are here. Thank you ipusnas"
"I'm a student, I can't login. I'm just confused, why is the facility apk from the country on this potato? It doesn't matter whether it's protected or not, it's just the same as having more errors. My interest in reading is high but I'm lazy. I'd better buy a book from reading it on this apk. Not to mention people's data is leaking. Surprised, this pdhl for the state should be able to make things easier. But why is it like this haha."
good
"I can't log in, even if I re-download it, it's still the same... using any account, it's the same! I downloaded more than 3 times"
"The apk is good, but a lot of the books I'm looking for aren't on Ipusnas. I suggest that Ipusnas add an ebook reference about language and literature or lecture books."
"Hi, please help I can't login, even though I've never registered"
"Can't log in using email using FB, everyone can't"
It's hard to login :'(( I don't know why
Very cool

"The application is very good because the course books I need are available but not complete, so I only gave 4 stars. And another advantage is that this book is free Thank youüôè"
"Why every time I want to borrow a book, it always runs out"
"The book is incomplete, there are very few references to civil engineering, even though in this pandemic era it is difficult to go to the library"
üëçüëçüëç
Thank you for the response ipusnas. I can login. And the ipusnas catalog is very useful for my paper reference‚ò∫.
"For books on religion, it should be corrected again, because there are still books that are not in accordance with the actual facts. the book should not be in the application, the book contains accusations without facts, to be honest, as a Catholic I object to the dark side of the Pope's book, the explanations in the book are wrong, can be misleading, the facts are not as alleged in the book, the book of dark history of the Popes is a distorted book."
"Finally I got a very extraordinary book application, for those who like to read this application is highly recommended, because the books are quite complete."
ok
"Ugly can't be opened, lazy to be in a bad mood"
Still can't.. even though it's true that I entered the email.. but it's still wrong. Is there another portal so that it's easy to enter
Can't register and it's hard to log in using Facebook
Thank you very much for the questions and answers
"I downloaded 5 times and still can't log in, using email I can't say the email has been registered even though it's a new email, even using fb it takes a long time to load even though the network is good, there's an incoming email from the admin already registered with Ipusnas, I tried to log in the password is wrong again, I tried to forget the password sent a link to change the password but it can't be accessed, the link is not valid!How can I use the application if logging in is difficult!"
Why are you having a hard time logging in?
"Good enough to use, for reading comics also the image quality is very good. However, there is no notification so that when there is a book that can be borrowed, the user will not know if they don't open the application. This apk is also very helpful to be able to borrow books via cellphone. Cool."
"I can't log in, I've tried repeatedly via the efbik account, email but it still doesn't work, please guide me üôèüôè I'll give you 2 stars, if you can enter, then fill it with stars"
"It's been a few days traffic jam, can't read a book. Please fix"

"Dear Allah. Hopefully, the iPusnas server can be better, God, and the collection will be increased. Amen"
Please fix when reading the book the background is blinking
Literacy Life
It's free right?
"Class like a national library but the collection of books/novels is very small. Moreover, popular novels"
Why can't I login
Bagud
Can't be downloaded even though the wifi signal and data are full of signal
"I can't register, what apk?"
Very often error :')
Why when I want to borrow the book you haven't verified the email yet. Even though I have verified the email. Ipusnas please answer
"Good, in an effort to improve Indonesian literacy"
"Sorry in advance because there are only 3 stars, because how come my account disappears so long ago, why? even though I have already registered, please add the collection again, thank you"

"Good, my suggestion is to add a save list to make it easier when looking for books before downloading"
Cool
It's hard to borrow a book
"This is really recommended. Everything I'm looking for is here. But I want to ask, how many days is the limit for borrowing books?"
"Why can't I login??? I've been trying to log in, how come it says ""please wait"""
"Can't borrow a book, the error keeps :("
"First, I like this application, it reduces the piracy of books in the community. And it's also easy to borrow books. But.. Disappointedly, I was looking for a lot of books but couldn't find them in the iPunas application. Then there will be more books."
"Hello, Sis, I've tried logging in using Facebook and email, I've been waiting for a long time but to no avail. I tried again and again, I can't log in, even though everything is correct. Please help, because I want to borrow a book for college purposes."
"Oh my gosh, the error continues, please fix it again, please"
Applications from the government never go wrong. Maybe less cost trillions of rupiah.
"very disappointed with IPusnas, before it was really good, now it can't even log in, the error is ""HDH, please fix it."
"Can you repair it again, it's been borrowed but it's not in the collection"
"very useful but unfortunately the application often loads errors for a long time. so often Uninstall and reinstall. if it's been a long time the error again. Uninstall again and again... the collection can be further complemented, so that it is commensurate with its national title."
"After a few months. This app can be said to be seriously damaged. Log out by itself, it's hard to borrow books."
"Why does it always fail to load?, the error keeps meberus. Please improve app performance"
"Oh my God, Sis, what's the problem again? Please fix it soon, Sis. üôè"
"For those who have a hobby of reading and need reading material and don't have enough budget to buy reading books, try downloading this application to just fill your time by reading books, because they say books are windows to the world... Let's read a lot of books... To broaden our horizons and point of view in studying an incident... You will be wiser by reading books... Thank you... APT"
"Failed to register, unknown reason"
"Country-class applications can have errors like this, they are inferior to startup startup applications. Why why why"
"Please fix the system. Every time I want to look for a book, I'm sure it's slow even though the network is good"
Lots of bugs
"Sorry, please fix the app, it's just crashing"
it's good that there is a digital national book
I want to read it but it doesn't work.... I can't log in using a facebook account... Using a new account is the same... That team sucks... the answer to the email is already registered... that's correct
"Very satisfied. Incidentally, my area is far from Gramedia and the Public Library. Very helpful. Thank you Ô∏è"
The application logs in frequently. So you have to re-login every time you open this application. And also often error if you want to borrow a book. And the appearance of the book is often different between the title and the cover of the book. Please fix it so that readers don't get nervous if they want to read. Thank you
I suggest don't download the application error is broken
Very supportive to improve people's reading literacy.
"Why can't I borrow a book? It always says ""failed, error unknown"" Pls fix the apk developersüôè"
Unable to register ! Always error
"Just downloaded, it's very difficult to login to create an account, login using Facebook ""please wait"" the wait is very long. You can't use gmail, it says the password is wrong"
"Defective application. Server timeout, finished borrowing, download, ask to download again. Just look at it"
"Very good library application, Why do I say good? Due to the current situation, it is not possible to buy a printed version of the book or borrow it directly from the library. So for that this media can be accessed and can be read by anyone. The collection is also large, although some books are not included, for some bugs, please fix them such as bugs, errors, and others. That's all from me, please pay attention in giving an assessment, thank you."
Buermamfaatt
"Very good, the collection is complete"
"Very good, suggestions for students / students are allowed to borrow for 5-6 months, it is also obtained to keep a lot of books, for the sake of educating the nation's life"
This iPusnas procurement program is great.
Ipusnas is a solution for people who want to buy novels but want to read original novels
How come I can't log in?
"I don't have a book, it's okay as long as I have this app"
"Now I want to borrow books from Ipusnas, I like it, I can't even though the application has been updated, there are many good books that I want to read, please fix it"
Very good and good
"It's difficult to log in for a long time. Trying to log in to FB, it doesn't work. Laaaaaaaaaaa trying to borrow a book. I can't get an error, I verified but I can't. This application is too strict to borrow books even though it's an online library for free, ask for verification. Ask for a password. My library is far away from my house only this is legal and friendlier!!!!!"
üëçüëç
"Why can't I borrow a book, it says ""Failed, you haven't verified. Check your inbox or spam box if it hasn't been found or please contact the ISpunas admin."" That's why, even though I've verified. please answer why there is writing like that . Just logged in, I can't read, I'm so angry, I'm so annoyed"
Goodüëç
Wow
"Hello Sis, sorry in advance, I want to login to the iPusnas application via Facebook or email but I can't, what's the solution, please?"
üëçüëçüëç
"Verification code not entered. So when you want to borrow a book, a notification appears to resend the notification email. Repeated the same process many times, but the verification email never arrived in the email inbox, neither in the Main Inbox nor in the Spam box."
"The application is worth it, the book is free and increases knowledge"
Very helpfulüëç
actually quite complete but the interface makes it less comfortable to read. fix again
"Bugs often, takes long to load, keeps failing network all the time. the book is incomplete"
Hello admins. What's the problem with this? Why can't I log in to log in to the application from the end of August? Even though I logged in once and then logged out myself :)
"Why is it difficult to log in to IPUSNAS? Login via email, the password is correct, but the password is wrong, I want to log in via fb and it takes a long time to load, I can't log in"
Bgs
I've downloaded it but when I enter FB OR EMAIL I can't? FB CONTINUES TO PLAY IF THE EMAIL IS WRONG THE PASSWORD EVEN WHEN IT IS CORRECT. AH NGESELIN
"I used to be able to, but tbtb I couldn't. Log in just not responding"
It's not possible to borrow the book at all.. please enter it please üôè I've tried 17 times TDK can't do it too
"My account has been logged out 2 times. Even though there is already a ""good book"" from hunting, I haven't read it huwaaaaa"
"Well, even though I've downloaded it but I can't log in...every login it takes a very long time to load, then it ends up exiting. Can't log in using fb or email..... sad sad sad"
Hmm... Reading app requires access to camera...
Very useful application
"Usually borrowing, why does it fail to download, it says you don't have a hold item, what do you mean? Please enlighten, thanks."
"Very grateful for this ipusnas application, an alternative for book lovers but can't buy many books yet. Lots of cool books here. World-class fiction books are also here. Thank you ipusnas. :)"
"I've been using ipusnas for more than a year and I've never had any complaints, but now I want to download a book it always fails due to maintenance repairs, unknown errors, no hold items... I don't understand. Even though you need it. I've updated, I've uninstalled and then reinstalled it still doesn't work. Please fix ASAP!!"
It's a good book but how come I can't login
"How is this pdhl already logged in using fb, how come it takes so long to load, I wait but it still says 'please wait' even though the signal is okay Kouta isn't there either. what is this?????????????!!!!!!!!!!"
Rungkadd siti
"How come this apk can't be accessed using email or fb, it's not really clear, even though it's in the name of a national team, but how come it's a mess?"
"good, highly recommend for students, thanks #bukamaen"
Why does the application always come out automatically when you click on a borrowed book?
"I forgot my password, then when I reset the password the link error happened many times. So I can't borrow books :("
Very helpful. But often lola gusti. Too much lag when it's on me
It's taking a long time to log in
"It's good, but please add a book about Christianity so that we Christians can be satisfied with this application"
"5 stars, because the application is useful..and keep adding the book.."
"Ipusnas is the number 1 best application in Indonesia, even though it is slow, keep upgrading this application so that the world of literacy continues to grow in this country and prove to the world that Indonesian reading interest is not as low as their surveys, go!"
"Great, good, quite complete"
Toppppp...
"It's really bad, when I want to log in using a Facebook account, it says the password is wrong. Pdhl the password is correct. Please fix it when you want to login, okay?"
The application really helps to get rid of boredom you can read good books that you want Soo download now
"iPusnas is very useful for Indonesian youth because it adds knowledge for free without buying books. The more cool, the success of iPusnas continues. Thank you"
The application is very useful for finding study reference books and others but the login process is very long :(
Why suddenly log out myself and can't log back in with Facebook?
Likes to read books. Found this application very good. Thanks for making it
Maybe you can add a quote search feature in the book reader so you can search for quotes
"Very useful application, but unfortunately not available on PC/laptop."
"Good, very."
Pleasant.
"Really good! I've been using this for a while and the only problem is the server problem. The book is also complete and varied. It's just that, the variety of the books can be improved. Ô∏è"
"The more updated the log in, the more difficult it is"
"The application is good and there are many books that can be read, and are the books that are read and borrowed free?"
"Thank you for the application, it is very helpful for digital book lovers. but my suggestion, update the appearance of the application, and notification of book availability can appear in the status bar on the phone screen."
"Every time you want to open a borrowed book, you always come out alone"
"Page 2 of 259 please scroll down a bit. It's a little annoying. Please add a word search feature in the book, bro :)"
"Hello, the app is great! But I'm confused, a few minutes ago I borrowed a book, but when I opened the bookshelf there were 2 of the same books. I tried to return it but can't, and also I want to ask. How long is the time limit for borrowing books in how many days?"
"iPusnas, please give a ring or notification that appears outside the application when the book in the queue is available. The problem is that I always fail to borrow books quickly because if you want to see notifications, you have to open the application first."
Thanks ^^
"BGus, the application is really useful üëç"
"Just to log in, it takes too long, repeats it again and again, it doesn't work :("
Read books for free. Get to know him without anyone.
it would be better if the developer created an auto return feature when the reader is done
"I regret updating ipusnas earlier versions can still use screenshots. After updating, it can't. Even though I need it for a college assignment, including proof of reference sources"
"Why can't I login, even though it's still safe, suddenly an error"
"Please fix it again, it's a shame if you read it gets interrupted because you often log out yourself and keep loading"
"Honestly, this app is very useful. I did not hesitate to give five stars. My hope is to fix bugs that sometimes loan books don't appear or errors etc., book loan quotas that hopefully can increase to more than five, pop up notifications when books are available (in queue), then added copies of books so you don't have to wait too long in the queue . Greetings literacy!"
thank you for presenting various kinds of free reading
"can't login via facebook, please wait from the stone age."
"How come my admin can't login, please advise even though I have registered at the ipusnas link."
Very nice
The solution to increase knowledge without buying books
Thank you can. The admin responded very quickly and was able to login too
"Thank you very much for the application. Very helpful for easy access to reading. I hope more people will read it. Besides that, sorry the rating went down a bit. I recommend having a book list feature here so I don't have to take out a loan for a book that I'm not ready to read. Thank you"
Really amazing collection. Hopefully the collection of good books will increase
"Why can't I log in, I've been waiting for a long time, I can't"
Why can't you continue to register? I want to read so I can't
Can't login
SO MISSING SCHOOL I usually like to read at school NOW PANDEMIC IS SO HARD
"Please fix the system immediately, yesterday I logged in and borrowed a book, but after that, why did I suddenly log out myself, and I couldn't log in either using email or using Facebook, it's really sad even though there are many books I want to read."
The more here the more frequent errors.
"I just found out that the national library has this app, didn't you know that a long time ago, you could read a lot more books? Thank you very much for this Ipusnas, so I can read/borrow books for free. But just a few times the app came out on its own, so just update it again. Ah yes, one more thing, the limit of books that can be borrowed is not two, please add more, so it's five... hehe Oh yes, one more thing, the collection of novels will be added again. Greetings Literacy"
"I still can't login, even though the internet connection is stable"
Hopefully this new version is more stable download the book. The old version is a bit difficult to have a good network.
"I can't login, why is that??"
"For those who like to read, very good"
"Even though the apk is good, it can't be screenshot :(("
"Ipusnas is really messed up, I can't login, I can't even create a new email, uninstall and reinstall, I still can't log in, it doesn't make sense, doesn't it?"
"I'm really tired of maintenance. Updated instead of being new, it's even more buggy."
Very helpful
"iPusnas, please pop up a notification for borrowing books and please consider adding the dark mode feature. Because I read books too often in bright conditions on my cellphone, it's not comfortable. Thank you.."
Useful app! Hopefully other cool features will be improved üëç
"A very useful application, there are many books that we can borrow and read legally and for free. Hopefully in the future it will be better for the progress of the nation."
"I have pressed borrow, but when I want to open the application, it comes out by itself."
Luv you ipusnas
"how come I want to download the desktop version, can't it bro?"
"whoever gave the idea and created this application was brilliant, finally able to borrow another book even though he was at home. Legal again"
Why can't ipusnas login now?
"Sorry to ask, what if you are looking for other users? I've searched for the username, but the user doesn't appear. My friend is also looking for my username, but can't find it."
"Since the stone age, I still can't log in. Email passwords are always wrong, even though they are correct. Login via Facebook also has no effect"
Very nice. Please upgrade
"I like iPusnas. Many books can be read here. Suggestions for adding a feature to extend the loan so that if you haven't finished reading the book, you don't have to search again and download it again. So it can save more time. Thank you"
"Do you really want Indonesian children to be smart? In my opinion, the collection of books in the field of science is not much. Because the title of the book that I want to look for is not there. Besides that, you can only borrow five books and return them in 3 days, which is too fast in my opinion. The number of copies is also not satisfactory, because when you want to borrow it, it runs out_- Also.. The translation book doesn't have a Samsek all the authors are from Indonesia, it's good, but it's still incompleteüò• excited for updates :)"
"Now it's a bug, yes, it often crashes. Please fix it again for mutual comfort, this is a real form of advancing literacy, right. Even so, the books are getting more varied"
"Give me one, because it's taking so long"
"Thank you very much for this online library, it really helped me a lot."
"The better the performance. Doesn't always log out on its own. The only thing that is still the biggest obstacle is that if you want to follow a friend, it's often difficult to find their account in the search feature. So my suggestion is that there will be a feature to share our account later. So it can be easier if you want to be mutual. Thanks"
"Why is there an error in the application, I've entered Emile but I can't borrow, I was told to re-enter it even though it's valid and sent, I'm sorry I finally uninstalled it"
Excellent
"Thank you ipusnas for being here. Honestly, I like to look for pirated books because I don't have the money to buy books, I'm very grateful for the presence of Ipusnas. Because reading is my metime place. Continue to develop Ipusnas in educating the nation's life"
"Very useful, but for a national library class the system needs to be improved. It's still a bit difficult to download even though the network is good, sometimes the borrowed book isn't on the bookshelf when it's offline. Etc but I was greatly helped by this application, a very useful application."
"Mhn the repair error continues, and can't be reloaded on the cellphone.."
"I really like this apk but it can't be opened for a long time, the error keeps happening, please fix the problem as soon as possible üôèüèª"
Very useful
Still need to be developed again. Because the application often crashes
"It's often difficult to download the book, sometimes it's an error"
"Thank you for providing legal free reading. It is hoped that the latest book collections will continue to be updated. In the previous version there was a feature to share book links but now it doesn't exist, I hope this feature will exist again and there should be a feature to remove books from the queue list."
"Thank you to Ipusnas for the repair, now it's running smoothly as it was in the beginning, hopefully the APS will develop better and be useful for many people"
"The latest version is now so cannot be screenshot. It would be better if there was a notification. For example, if a book on the queue list is available, there will be a notification immediately, without having to open the application first. Thank you for providing a free ebook."
"It's been a long time since I downloaded it but I just logged out of my own account and if I want to log in, I can't and it just says network timeout."
I just can't log in.. I can't retrieve data and there's no DLS. What do you mean?
"It's been days why I still can't open, can't login, even though I really need it. Please develop more, so that the server is more stable."
"No connection mulu, pdhl wifi is stable for other apks, full data package, registering for a google account can't work. Please fix it, the Ipusnas class is like this."
"VERY BAD, LOST CONNECTION, LONG QUESTION, ERROR, CRASH!"
"Maintenance continues, annoying."
"Loading connecting only, I'm annoyed"
"The application often crashes, the national library, but why is it like this"
"Currently 3 first, really lag. I can't open the book. Please improve it. It's definitely possible, I support it to advance the interest of Indonesian literacy"
Still with server problem
"The title of the book is interesting, all hopefully the results are appropriate"
"Worst! It's really hard when I borrow a book, the download size is small, but it sucks to fail, so I'm lazy to read it, just open another apk, don't download it, minimize it to the other one, too lazy"
More complete! top!!!
less user friendly
"I have become a socializer and borrowed more than 700 times or books, if you imagine going to a physical library, it might be tiring"
"It's amazing, it's really cool. Helping people whose hobby is reading"
"Please add a feature (wishlist) so that the books you want to read are not borrowed at once. Plus, let's not forget which book was it that we wanted to read."
"From last year until now I can't log in, it just appears ""please wait"" and there are lots of application error notifications even though I really need it, can this application only be accessed using expensive cellphones?"
"Thank you! It really helps to add reading material, there are so many kinds"
"Sis, how come the book I'm looking for is on the National Library's web list, but when I search for the Ipusnas app, it's not there, right?"
"Bismillah.. why when you open it ""Unable to retrieve data from server and no DLS"" please help üôè"
"How come it can't be opened, there's no DLS it says :("
"Please improve this service again...it's really hard to open the apk, sometimes it doesn't even show up even though the signal is good"
"Bro, why can't I log in, I use Facebook loadinggg then, the internet quota works fine. Using email, the password is wrong and then, even though, it's correct. please"
"The problem still occurs, exits when you want to read or click on a loan book"
"Actually, this apk is really good, I can borrow books legally + no need to go far to the library, especially if you want to borrow novels that are often not available in the library. The only thing that makes it is enough here, because when you queue for a book, then the borrower has finished reading it, there's no notification on the lockscreen It's only in this apk. As a result, every queue for the book is already ahead of the others. So please fix this please. There's a notification in the apk, okay, but if you add a notification on the lockscreen, it's more comfortable right?"
It's useless
"Min, the Ipusnas is having problems, please fix it, min. Thank you"
"Hello admins. This app is very good and helpful for reading ebooks. But for features such as bookmarks, word search, in my application can not be used. So it's a bit difficult to continue the last page I read. In addition, the application often crashes. I hope that this application is developed even better. Excited for the admins and thank you for presenting the library in the form of an application."
Very often error zzzzzz
"Very useful, especially during this Pandemic it is difficult for us to go out of the house, there are also quite a lot of books, hopefully more and more books are added, the more complete, comfortable to add insight wherever and whenever we want Thank you to the developers and all parties involved develop it üòçüòò"
"The application is slow if you want to borrow an ebook. More ebooks must be reproduced, especially when the National Library of Indonesia is closed during PPKM"
The collection of new books is not much.
"It's good, I hope you get a dark mode, because in light mode, your eyes hurt hehe"
"Just downloaded, and the result is that the application cannot be opened, please give the admin... to fix the existing shortcomings."
"Why do I fail to keep logging in to iPusnas? Every time you enter there must be a sentence, ""Failed to retrieve data....."
"Thank you ipusnas. Thank you, the application is very helpful. Thank you for the people in it. I wish you more success and progress. By reading a lot. Long live my country."
"For an app with a ""true national"" appendage, it is not feasible, access is difficult and a coup d'etat"
The UI is good and the book is quite complete but unfortunately it can't be highlighted. Even though the highlight function when reading a book is very important
very good in my personal opinion
Why can't you login?
"Library solutions in the midst of a pandemic, and endless PPKM. GOOD JOB IPUSNAS"
I just checked the application.. there are too many books.. cm always gets an error when opening. And it seems that there is no intention to fix it.
"Thank you. In this time of pandemic, reading has become something that is very often done to kill boredom. Excited to keep updating. Oh yes, please add a feature for book suggestions, please.."
"please update the system immediately, it's really bad like it suddenly lags, many menus don't work"
"Sorry, I changed the Ipusnas admin to 2 stars because the application often has errors, whether it's a book that cannot be borrowed even though there are still many loan slots, every time I want to read it always says ""Ipusnas keeps stopping"", and there is an error in the connection even though the internet is running smoothly."
"The application is really good, it makes it easy for me especially to get many kinds of literacy. Permission to give advice, maybe later we can add additional features such as ""related books"" (or what is the term) for series books to make it easier to find hehe. Thank you Ipusnas, hopefully more in the future üëçüëç"
The app is very helpful! Especially for my area which is far from the bookstore and the library.
The book is not complete
"The application carries out the mandate of the 1945 Constitution, namely in the context of educating the nation's life. Thank you iPusnas"
"i love you, and growing bigger, library! help, for people who do not allow the situation to shop for books. I am a literary reader. I really hope that this library will be richer with healthy readings, and understand what (books) people are looking for/needed/wanted as readers. Ô∏è"
"The application is very good, very useful. I can borrow foreign language books, especially Korean language learning books"
GG says inspiration
very stingy
"when I took the queue to borrow books and waited, it turned out that there was already a notification when I entered the application that the book was available but the notification was not received on the cellphone like other applications. Hopefully next time I can give a notification when the book is available, the rest is goodüôè"
Less satisfied
why ask for access to system settings?
"Why can't it be opened, the writing doesn't have DLS, what does that mean?"
"Min...why can't I borrow it? In the textbox is written an order to register as a member, then asked to enter a password. I have entered the password several times and it is correct. But why still fail huh?. Why does it say failed? Even though I have entered the password correctly. Please help. Thank you."
Very useful app
Long wait in line
"Good application, hopefully more advanced aamiim"
The program is too complicated
"Can't screenshot, the application doesn't allow it, why?"
"A very good breakthrough, making it easier for the public to be able to access various reading materials. But I'm still confused, why are there books in stock??"
It's just a suggestion that application updates are carried out regularly because there are still many errors / bugs that hinder readers
Cool.. Even though it often error
Very nice
Best
"Cool application, keep it up, God Bless üôè"
"Great job! But please upload the books that are interesting to read, don't be like the books in the school library hehe"
Nice lurd.....
üôèüèº
"Developers, please, give the hilight feature to all books and text copies to make it easier.."
Very bad. Every time you open the app you have to login. How is the interest in reading 62 going up? It's so hard to log in
Errors keep on
"I'm so happy that there is this application to fill my spare time during the pandemic.. but unfortunately there are many books that don't exist, ky Raditya Dika, Fiersa Besari n Pramoedya Ananta Toer,, please complete"
"Please, there is a notification like an incoming message if there is an empty book queue. Time to open the new application there is a notification"
WL
I love bag
Very bad application...what's wrong with entering a password
Best selling books are always not available.
Very helpful
"Pls, reproduced articles about history, please. But the good ones, for example, biological weapons and Romusha as guinea pigs, not the many articles that are circulating on the internet. I've read the book, it's very good to increase knowledge, tq"
clear apk
really helped me in reading
Can't open it
why is it so difficult to download this apk on the desktop?
"Min, how come I can't read books on Ipusnas, right? pdhl i have registered."
"Sorry admin, I've installed this app 2 times, but why do I always have trouble logging in? Using a FB account or email still can't. What do I have to do?"
"It's really cool, you can read free books, just download it on your cellphone. Those who want to read please download while there is an application as good as this free again!"
Application cannot be opened
"The apk is not clear, when an error occurs, it has to be above Android 5, when the cellphone is out now, Android 5, if you want a big rating, please fix it so it doesn't disappoint the user"
"If possible, suggestions for improving the grouping of books provide filter features according to the year of publication, which publication, genre, and author."
Thank you for accompanying our family with free knowledge. HAPPY!
"I swear this application is very useful, I just installed it for about 3 weeks, during PPkm at home I read books from Ipusnas. Thank you"
Can't open
"Please make book recommendations on the homepage tailored to objects that users often search for, such as YouTube recommendations. Very often at home, the books are not interesting and don't connect with the topics I'm often looking for"
"Masha Allah. Indonesian people must have this apk. To make it easy to read every day. Because the first commandment of Allah swt is reading, so we should make reading a priority, especially reading the Qur'an for Muslims, even though only a few can be read but consistent."
"Complicated. Official government app, but this poor quality? Shame."
"Please remove the ""queue"" please make it unlimited, when you want to read it, queue up thousands of people"
nice
Still error
"The book is complete, and the application is very practical Thank you ipusnas for helping a lot during the current pandemic"
"Dear developer, I wish the foam application was even better. I often crash when going to read a book and the network is not detected. Besides that, why do books need to be limited in copy? To increase people's interest in reading, shouldn't the number of copies be freed?"
"I like fiction and non-fiction books, they are all very good and of good quality‚ú®"
"This is outrageous, it's really bad how come there is this application. It's really useful, how come you lost to a dotted game, why I use all of my accounts to give 5 stars, if I need 1000 stars, it's really useful"
"Suggestions for iPusnas, if a new message arrives in the chat box, please put a mark on the 'inbox' panel or instead give a notification so that the message can be read immediatelyüôè"
I like the app but why does it take so long to load to find a book. Books that have been downloaded are hard to find. Please fix the bug. Because the internet network is good but still difficult to load. Thank you
"Min, I'm sorry, I want to ask why every time I want to open the application, I can't open it, then there is an error saying ""There was an error, I can't retrieve data from the server and there is no DLS"" even though my internet network is good, what is this caused by, min? Even though I really want to read books at iPusnasüòØ"
Good application please improve again
Masha Allah. Very useful for the intelligence of the nation. Hopefully later the books will be more complete.
"The application is getting slower, loading is super long just to be able to download"
Good app
"With this application, even though you are at home, you can still read. Whatever we want there is very good completeüëç. I hope there will be more novels and biographies in the future. Thank you very much."
"honest; This cannot be used by blind users. even though we also need digital books like this one. if it can be fixed so that it can be read by screen readers, especially for the blind or blind people."
"Sorry, I just installed it, but there is info, I can't retrieve data, what does it mean? Please fix it"
"The book, please add philosophy books like the blind man from Pluto's cave or the world of Shopie"
Fix it
Why do I have an error?
"Sis, what if you can't retrieve server data and there's no DLS? It's a shame this app can't be opened I'm confused"
"Assalamualaikum Alhamdulillah, this is a very useful application, just don't be afraid to make an application, I'm sure the funds from the state will be sufficient for the development of applications like this. My advice, please, improve the UI/UX. Some additional features such as better book sorting, book categorization by author, year, or publisher and please support landscape mode. I hope my suggestion is acceptedüòá ‚ù§Ô∏èMake Indonesia Read Again‚ù§Ô∏è Wassalamu'alaikum"
too much access
Why can't it be opened?
"I like this application, very useful, this application is like a real library, a lot of good and useful reading."
"On the 17th, why is there an error y the description cannot retrieve data from the server and there is no DLS.? Please fix it immediately, thanks."
"Please, make a feature to sort books from the most popular, newest, etc. to make it easier to find interesting books, and improve the UI / appearance please"
"Min, can you fill in this book ""China's economic reform and the rise of the renminbi"" urgent minüôè"
It's so bad I can't be accessed. The email is not clear. It's also been a long time using FB eww IPUSNAS I WANT TO READ THE BOOK How can I enter this??üò≠üò≠üò≠
The application: NOT CLEAR!!
"If I may suggest, there is no need for the number of copies or copies, just make it unlimited but still given a time limit for reading. I often have difficulty when I want to borrow but it turns out to be out of stock and the wait is also quite long for several days. May I know what is the purpose of the limit on copies of the book?"
It's better.
"The application is good. It would be even better if there was a book preview so readers could know what was discussed in the book, it's not enough with a synopsis. For me, it will be very helpful if the book I want to borrow provides a minimum preview of the book's table of contents."
The best booküòç
Nice!
Useless wkwk
Why do you want to read a book that is borrowed by force close?
Really good. This application is really recommended for reading books during the pandemic üëçüëçüëç
"Cheers, iPusnas developers, for the better progress of Indonesian science üëç, God be with you."
"Very helpful application. The book collection is quite complete :) Just a suggestion, it's better if you don't just enter the book queue notification when you use the application. So, it's easy to get the book you're looking for^^"
"Please answer, why every time I want to return the book it always fails and it says invalid item? What do I have to do"
"I am a little disappointed with this application as soon as I just downloaded and entered immediately the sentence ""Unable to retrieve data from server"". I thought the internet connection problem was not, it's been a week it can't open.."
Ô∏è
"Add a night mode please, so it's pleasing to the eye"
"Sorry, but why can't I read the book even though it's still in stock? then I was told to check my email even though there was no email from Ipusnas that came in for verification, so I couldn't read books in this application."
Tried to login several times but couldn't. It's really sad even though I want to find a book for the next SMT material.
good
"Is Ipusnas currently having an error, it can't be opened?"
slow in accessing existing features. Not effective.
I downloaded this to read other story books from the number 1 Indonesian band NOAH
Excellent
It really helps me when I'm tired of reading books so I can read on the app
"How come I fail to log in ""unable to retrieve data from server and no DLS"" please help"
why no notification? so I don't know when the books in the queue are available or not. Please add the loan amount too
Nice app. But please upgrade. The book stock is also added
"it's really cool, but it's a shame the book collection is very small, how long do you have to queue, how long does it take, even if there's been a year waiting in line, you can't get your book :("
"The collection of books offered is quite complete, however, turning pages if we choose to transition to the side is not as comfortable as when using a play book. That's all I feel uncomfortable. Thank you for giving us free reading access ( )·êü"
"Please fix the system. When the app is opened, error info always appears"
Great app. I have no reason to rate an app as good as this one with one star.(Why do people give one star to an app as good as this? Is reading that still too hard to do?)
A little disappointed because I can't login to this app
"I failed to login repeatedly, it says ""unable to retrieve data from server"" even though I have reinstalled this application. Hopefully there will be improvements from Ipusnas, because unfortunately there are many interesting collections at Ipusnas but I can't read them."
"Very disappointed, why is logging in at Ipusnas so difficult? Tried several times, still can't."
Good but often jams
"Good morning sis, I just downloaded the ipusnas apk, but why can't I open it"
Incredibly very usefulüôèüòä Thank you iPusnas
"Good app, coolüëç"
"The application is good, the books are quite a lot, even the book that I have been eyeing for a long time is here. Maybe a little advice, for reading convenience, please add a font size option. It's quite difficult to enjoy reading in small letters on a cellphone, thank you"
I am very disappointed with this application. I was only able to log in after trying a few times.. maybe 1 week with a few tries. the notification doesn't even appear on the cellphone so I don't know when the queue book can be borrowed again... and also I've logged in why do I often go out by myself? and also need a lot of data to open it unlike other reading apps
Why can't it be opened? It says the data can't be accessed
Thank you this is very helpful üòäüëç
"So far I like it.. but there are not many books that I want to read can I request or not? If so, where are you?"
Keep on working
"Really good. There are lots of quality e-books to read, from fiction to non-fiction. Very useful, apart from being free, the book borrowing period is also quite long"
"This application is good. Even better if there is application development, so readers are more comfortable and easy to use. For example, there is a book classification feature for each publisher. Classification of books every year of release, also the most popular / most read books. There can be bookmarks (to save interesting books, so it's easier to find them if you want to read them in the future). Hopefully in the future this application will be even better :)"
SERVER DOWNüòè
"At first I was really excited to download this app, then it didn't open, how come it didn't work, it said ""no server connected and no DLS"" I don't know what that means even though I just downloaded it and my signal is smooth, please help the developer"
The application is very helpful for learning
Why isn't there a search menu that can make it easier for users to find the book they want?
Grandiose loading fixes my old old stress
"Please add the collection of books to make it more complete and also add the number of copies so that more readers can read the book, the queue is very long and long while the book wants to be read in full. Please fix again"
"So you can read and read without mumbling ""away from the library"" that's all, stand in line."
"Sorry, why every time I borrow a book at iPusnas it takes a long time to load and keeps failing. Please respond üôèüôè Thank you"
"Thank you for the very helpful application. By the way, I have a question about how many days is the loan limit for this application? Then if the time for HBS is automatically returned / have to wait for the person to remember? And why do you have to queue up all the time, even though you're online? If you can, add a feature that allows users to recommend books to be added to the application and a feature that allows other users to know the deadline for books borrowed by other users, so you can be ready to borrow. Sorry wholesale, thank you.."
Very good for us people who want to read but don't always have the money to buy books
"The app is good, but why do you always get an error can't borrow a book"
"Really good. Can read a variety of books, both fiction and non-fiction. My suggestion, please add to the collection of novels by Tere Liye. Especially the Raib, Seli, and Ali series. Thank you for making such a useful app like this one."
iPusnas is very helpful especially equipped with various categories But please add a search feature by typing the title to make it easier to find books
Why is it difficult to login via Facebook? Via email is also difficult. Whereas other applications can directly login without having to wait long.
"Lots of interesting book choices. Using the app is also easy & most importantly, no ads"
"Please keep the application updated, when I open it, it doesn't always come out on its own. This is a national library, lol, in a national class at a time like this"
"The application is very good, my advice is to multiply the ebook copies and to vary the reading display. The only drawback is that we can't edit the reading history so that the books are not duplicated that have been borrowed 2 or more times. Thank you"
I like the app
"Hello, why is it so hard to log in huh? With Facebook for a long time there was only the words ""please wait"" but it was stuck there. Tried logging in using email instead my password is said to be wrong. I really need to borrow a book."
"It's good that there are many books in it, it can be used for reading or studying as well"
"Very helpful in finding books that are expensive and difficult to access, thanks to the provider ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Please fix again, there are still many bugs"
"Even though I have turned on notifications, every time I get a notification for a book is available, the notification never appears. So I always run out of books."
Very helpful and helpful. Thank you very much. Good luck for the future. Hopefully it can survive and be free so that it adds insight and knowledge as well as the desire to read.
Very good. Hopefully the books will always be updated.. I hope that the appearance is made contemporary so that young readers are interested.
Now it's ok
"During the pandemic, ipusnas really helped me in finding literacy for my final project. In addition, ipusnas also has many good novels. My suggestion is that the ipusnas application has a darkmode feature. So it's not too bright if you want to read with the lights off"
very helpful
"hey, why can't I read the book? please fix"
"I don't know anymore now the application often comes out by itself. Just about to open it, it's out again, how do you want to use it?"
It's a good app
"I like this application, the collection is large. However, one of the books in Rick Riordan's The Heroes of Olympus: The Son of Neptune series does not yet exist. And I hope that Ipusnas can provide the book The Son of Neptune. Because I see a lot of people asking in the book review column in The HOO: The Mark of Athena series, and readers want The Heroes of Olympus: The Son of Neptune. That's my review, sorry if there are mistakes, thank you. üôèüèª Greetings literacy."
Lots of bugs. don't take care
"The application is really good. At my place the library is kilometers away. So I feel helped by the Ipusnas, especially when there are bestseller books (the worst thing is having to queue for a long time if you have borrowed a lot). But the application often comes out alone when reading a book (eg. when I want to go back to a page that I've read suddenly comes out) please fix this bug."
"Overall (features, services, how to borrow, etc.) are good and quite easy and interesting too. But unfortunately some science reference books are not yet available here. My advice, add a collection of knowledge books. Both books by Indonesian writers/researchers and books by foreign authors, so that Indonesian students' references are more diverse. When there are many references, the knowledge generated will be more optimal in the midst of the uncertainty of the pandemic. Ipusnas spirit!"
hihi cool. thanks ipusnas. so you can read at home during the covid pandemic..
Alhamdulillahirobbilalamaiin.. The existence of the Ipusnas application is very helpful to add insight. Admin please add more for the collection of the book collection.
"Just downloaded but still in the maintenance process, even though I want to borrow a book. How long will it take to fix it?"
"What you are looking for, what appears?"
Alhamdulillaah.. this is the heaven of books and everything can be accessed for free. Thank you ipusnas.‚ù£‚ù£‚ù£üëç
"I don't understand why applications managed by the government are of this quality. Honestly, I often have problems accessing this application even though my network is good. When operated also likes to go out alone. Though this should be very helpful. Please fix"
"Very helpful, but the app often crashes :(( limited availability of books :(("
The app is good. Keep improving
The concept is good but the user interface is not friendly. Please pay dearly for the developer so that he is enthusiastic about his work
Quite a large collection of books
"Why is it so difficult to borrow, even though the account is correct, the email is correct but still can't borrow, I don't understand... please fix it again"
can't be opened out on its own
"Helped Ririn read the novel, thank you so much."
Joss gandos
I've downloaded it but how come it can't be opened?
Very nice
Good.. please give old books digitalized too. Especially culture and history.
Please add your favorite features so you don't have to search here and there anymore
The book collection is ok
"Very often the notification ""problem loading books categories, no connection please check your connection"" appears even though the connection to open other applications is running smoothly... it's been a long time but this bug has never been patched"".."
Extraordinary
Have joined since 2017

"This ipusnas has an error again, the book that I borrowed is not on the bookshelf. Please tell me to register as a member, and the writing keeps failing huhu :("
"I've been expecting a lot from the apk, but I know it's not as expected. The novel isn't complete, the apk often gets errors, so there are some well-known books that have very little stock and have to wait months to read them"
Thank you for giving birth to a library that can be visited anywhere and anytime. Very helpful. Suggestion. Please add a search by publisher and a feature such as a wish list. Often find cool books but the loan quota is full or when you don't really need it. Sometimes also forget the title if you want to search again.
"Fairly easy to borrow and read books. But the available books are not so complete, hopefully the books can be more varied"
Greetings literacy
"Make the apk, just delete it"
I really like it! So there is no need to go back and forth to the National Library to borrow books. Thank you the government for making this application <3
"Sorry admin, there are still many incomplete books for student assignments, because I rely on these apps"
"The application is good, but it would be nice to add features such as a wishlist as a feature to add books when you find interesting books to read next. üëç Same features when we search, there should be a history so when we want to borrow again we can remember that. üëç"
Excellent
"iPusnas good app. Help find reference books for college assignments. But why lately my account can't login at all? Reinstalled, but still the same. Please solve. Thank you. Today I tried to log in again and still can't. Even though the internet connection is poor. How's that huh?"
The apk is cool. Hope the collection of best selling books is added!!!
"Sorry, login can't retrieve data from the server, please fix it"
"It's actually a good app to be able to borrow books. But why the stock of books is limited? So those who really need a book take a long time to queue and end up not getting the book. This is an online library, not offline, why is the system still using an offline system? The government is asking for the understanding that the system is improved and the process is simplified. WE ARE STUDENTS WHO ONLINE RESEARCH AND CAMPUS CLOSED DUE TO PANDEMIC WANT TO GRADUATE QUICKLY"
mantqp
The book is quite complete
Very nice
Please add a notification feature on your cellphone for queue books that already exist. It's been weeks waiting in line for books and even though it's quick to open the book stock app it's still 0
"The advantages of the Apk are that it is convenient and practical, and it's also free, the books are all well-known. The drawback is that sometimes it takes a long time to load, then if you're looking for a book according to the category it says ""data not available"", I don't know why. Please complete the book again, the questions are really good..."
Like the apk
good
"Still a lot of bugs. Especially when downloading a book, the app always pops up on its own. Even though it wasn't"
Like error
Have visited offline. Turns out the online is okay too
"A very helpful application for book lovers, both students and the general public. Let's immediately download and explore the breadth of knowledge"
"Very useful, moreover save costs because the t4 library is far from home. But because it's a digital visual book, it's not sure to feel comfortable reading it. If there is an audio book, it will be very helpful"
Excellent
"Very helpful, thank you!"
Let the stars do the talking.
"Very good application, thank you I can read at home with ease thanks to this application"
"Sorry, I can only give one star because the application has been downloaded. But when I register on fb, I write, please wait. Why is that??üôè"
Agree
"really like this app!!! add insight and entertainment in your spare time!! I really hope that the School For Good and Evil series will be added to 4, 5, and 6...please add the other series as well ü§ß Continued success for iPusnas!"
How come it can't be loaded
"Thank you for the response.. in the future hopefully the ""dark background"" feature can be enabled, and there is a feature to enlarge the letters according to the wishes of the reader. Add more to the collection of best selling books. Greetings literacy."
Efforts are progressing even though they must continue to be addressed.
"The app is very good and useful. Thank you ipusnas. Can I have a little advice. One of the minuses is that after I return a book, I can borrow the book right away. Hopefully, there will be an improvement in the system so that newly returned books cannot be borrowed directly. There must be a minimum of 24 hours after the return. The goal, so that a book is not monopolized by someone. Thank you"
"The app is good, so you don't have to be tired of spending money/going to the library. If you say it's complete, it's not really, but the book is quite a lot. The problem I'm experiencing now is that when I'm searching for a book, the search results don't come out right away, so I have to wait for about a minute. The problem with waiting for a long book is that I understand it, it's not just us who download the application. Hopefully in the future Ipusnas can be even better & can encourage Indonesian people's interest in reading"
"Please add the wishlist feature, bro"
"The application is very good, please increase the stock of books because many popular books are out of stock"
"I really like this application, it can really help with final students, as a suggestion that there are more new books, such as online learning books that we have experienced so far. Ok thank you üòä"
Sorry in advance but why can't I borrow the book? The book stock is still there though. But why was the recommendation told to check email? Even though I have filled in the data completely. Developers please.
"I like this application, but my suggestion is to add a feature to save the books you want to read (not borrow). Because sometimes when I already borrow a book, I find a new book that I want to read later. That way I can easily find the book. Thank you"
"There is an error, the application exits when opening a book that has been borrowed. Please fix it soonüôè"
"Sorry, I gave 1 star, because when you download it on a laptop, you can, but when you open it, you want to log in using fb, how come it says ""sorry the application has not been prepared, it is under development, blablabla"" why is that? Is it true that the application is still under repair? Or it can't be accessed via a windows laptop? Please follow up, thank you"
"I don't know, I just downloaded it, but why can't I login, I can't use my email, even though it's already in accordance with the email or PW, why does it take so long to connect to fb?"
"This is the library application I'm looking for. For those who want to download and install it, you won't regret it, but sorry bro, when I wanted to read it, I force closed Mulu and it still forces close againüôè Please explain"
"After downloading, how come the application can't be opened, it always says can't retrieve data from the server"
"Thank you, this application really helped me in doing my final project. I found many book references in the ipunas application. Ô∏è"
GOOD BGT HSHS
Why can't I verify my email? ?
Reading books becomes easier at Askes from the iPusnas serviceüëçüëçüëç
it's really good but sometimes there's no error because it's still good hehehehe
"How come I finished downloading the book, it came out on its own right?"
"Please fix it, the application often crashes plus very few copies of the book. This is a national library, the number of copies of its books should be increased."
Very helpful
"I suddenly can't connect to the server and there's no dsl... what's the solution, friend..."
"Min, why does the application display a flickering screen and some pages suddenly go dark mode? I've re-installed it but it's still a problem"
"Add more books so there are many choices when reading, very good"
Why does it keep getting errors when I open it? Please fix
"Hello sis admin, sorry in advance. I just downloaded ipusnas but when it finished downloading the application it said it couldn't enter because there was no DLS data. How is that? Please help"
Is it because it's free that the software system in this application is very dilapidated and slow?
"Sorry to give one star, because when I downloaded it and entered the application it said sorry DLS DLS gtu, I really wanted to read it here. In the picture there is the next article, so if there's no one to interact with me"
Yo manteb boss qu
"Helping in reference, unfortunately for popular novels I hope there will be additional stock because the queue for each reader is very long. Then for new novels from top writers, I hope that Ipusnas will upload them soon. Besides all that, ipusnas is the right way to save pockets for those who want to read books (stop buying pirated books, respect the author)."
"Just downloaded. Why can't I open the app? Always ""unable to fetch data from server and no DLS"". Why is that?"
I gave one star and I reinstalled it because it couldn't be opened
How to make an account. There is no creating an account via email. Just forgot password feature
"You can add a zoom feature or you can choose the font size, because the letters in the book are too small. So that it's comfortable. Thank you IPUSNAS"
"Every time I want to read it always comes out, why is that?"
"Well, I want to read but it doesn't support, there are still a lot of bugs"
This is a useful application. Please develop and improve to make it even better.
"Please update and develop continuously. Because the application is very helpful. Add a feature to replace the background with dark mode, so it doesn't hurt the eyes of the reader. Fix all the bugs and extend the loan period of the book. Thank you"
This app is really recommended üòçüòç
Can't open the app
"It's very useful during a pandemic like this ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§, you can even find books that have been eyed for a long time. Thank you iPusnas, hopefully it will be even better :)"
nice
Really good
Until now the application often error
"Hello iPusnas... Sorry I want to ask, why can't I access iPusnas now??? It's been a long time since I opened iPusnas...Every time I open it always appears ""no DLS"" continues... Please fix it again soon. ..So that I can access iPusnas againüòî Thank you... Literacy greetings‚ù§"
10/6/2021. The book I want to read can't be opened and immediately exits the application
"The book is quite complete But errors often occur and log out of But can't log back in, wait for hours the writing remains: ""please wait"". please fix, thank you"
Good Application...
Very good app
It's really hard to log in
Busuok
Thank you for making this application because it can search for reference books and novels without the need to pay but please add a notification feature if the book in the queue is available because the notification never appears so we don't know when the book is available. because of that we find it difficult to borrow books.
"large collection of books. Please, make a separate category for books from the Tempo Data and Analysis Center, so that you are more comfortable when looking for books in other categories."
"How do you want to give a rating... Just open the application, the error is Mulu... wait, you can't do it"
Why can't I login with my email...?? Are there any obstacles?
"If you think about it completely, it turns out that most of the books you are looking for don't exist, such as the holes in the PKI massacre in Madiun. Disappointed. Uninstall itüòÅüòä"
thank you very useful
"Why can't I open the app? When you want to go back, you can't"
Bad. The book doesn't appear at all. Please fix the application please.
Just found out I want to try ipusnas
"Admin, when you click download the book it says, ""Failed. You don't have a hold item"" what does that mean? even though there are still 4 books left üôè please fix it and give a solution."
"How come it's getting more and more complicated, it's not clear. Cook every 3 minutes straight out and in itself, every time I enter I'm even told to log in again. Please fix it"
good book
"Min, it's true, I've reset my password several times + my email has been given the password, but it doesn't always match"
How come when I log in from fb it always says please wait. even so much longer
It's easy to get an error.. when opening the category column it often crashes..
"I used to like this app. I can finish 2-3 books a week. now there are frequent errors, loading takes long, & books cannot be borrowed. if so, it's free..."
"Alhamdulillah,, the application is very helpful"
"It's very good, it's just that please provide a school curriculum package book. In my opinion, school textbooks according to the applicable curriculum should also be provided."
"it's still getting an error, bro, please fix it again :)"
I love reading. I really like this application.
Can't open yet
"The app is good. Very helpful. But PLEASE FIX IT AGAIN. Every time you want to borrow proof, wait for email verification. While in the inbox there is no verification code from this apk"
"I can't open it with Facebook, it takes a long time to load"
"This apk is very good, but please fix it again, operatorüôè. Because sometimes like the apk error. Hopefully the apk can be developed again so that literacy in Indonesia can advance. The spirit of the younger generation."
"Easy to use, great app. Please add the dark mode feature"
I can't login to my account
"The application is good, min and there are fewer errors, maybe my suggestion is to increase the collection of books, especially subject books and books for lecture activities, thank you üôè"
"Why is this apk? How come I can't log in either using a fb account or email. Even though if I log in on the web or other apk, it's smooth. What is this?"
"The application is good. But it would be even better if you added a wishlist button, so you don't have to look for the book again. Thank you"
"Why when it's installed and want to open it says ""cannot access server and no DLS""?"
"Actually, the application is good,,, looking for any book is complete,,, but loading takes too long to read,,,, sometimes it doesn't come out,,,hemz,,,please fix it if it's normal I will change the review"
"Please provide the reading feature from right to left, please. Because at iPusnas there are several manga. So, let's read the manga better to see it. Especially the double-page. If you go from left to right, it's weird, the double-pages are separated. Thank you"
Please add the number of copies of books that are popularly read
"Please, admin. How come the application is getting unclear? When I first downloaded it, I could access all the books. But after a long time, there are lots of notifications that don't connect (errors). Sometimes it tells me to log back in, sometimes it fails to download when I want to borrow a book, and sometimes it gets a ""system error"" notification. Until I have re-downloaded this application 4 times. Even though I still have a lot of needs with books, but it's getting more complicated."
Why do I want to login using a facebook account but can't log in and the screen just keeps loading for almost an hour..
"Hello, thank you for making this application. With this application, it is easier for me to find books or novels and even comics for free even illegally. I often read at night, but the background color is white, right? If so, I have a suggestion, how about providing a dark background (dark mode) to make it easier to read at night, hehehe, because white is too bright. Thank you very much, sorry if there are words that are not pleasing üôèüòÑ"
Keep improving
"Please help, I can't login :)"
"I want the Ipusnas apk to have a favorite feature so I can mark which ones I'll read later, because the maximum loan is only five books :("
very very helpful
Why does this application say error 'even though it's just downloaded?...
"The application is good but why can't it be used, the file is not being found, please fix it soon"
"Errors often occur, when you want to borrow or return books. Often when borrowing, an unknown error occurs, registration, and the button cannot be pressed, also the book cannot be borrowed even though there are still several copies. The book is quite complete. Please improve the application again. Thank you"
"The row of loan books is quite complete, but there are some bugs when borrowing or returning the book, please pay attention again! :)"
Why is the application error now
"The application is very helpful, but why can't borrow lately?? Please fix the server again, because I really need reference books for this application... Thank you"
"When I want to borrow it, there is an error, please fix it"
"It's really bad, I'm confused about how to use it when I'm logged in, I still can't borrow. it says ""failed! You have become a member"""
Actually the application is good but why does it keep getting errors? So does that mean you don't have a hold item? Why is it so difficult for me to borrow a book... Please explain
"The application is very good, very helpful, but after being used a few times an ""unknow error"" often occurs even though my network is stable, my account also often logs out by itself, sometimes if I want to borrow a book it takes a long time to load and ends up in error, the application suddenly exits by itself"
"Actually the application is good, making it easier for people to get reading. It's just that it's still very unstableü•≤too frequent errors Maybe it's better to fix it soonüëç"
One day and then the error again? What is this?
"It's a good application, but why is it so hard to borrow now?"
I gave a rating of 2 first because it keeps getting errors. Please fix it soon...
"This application is actually good because it encourages reading interest in Indonesia and minimizes the consumption of pirated books. However, for now the process of borrowing books is quite difficult, even though the internet connection is good. Please improve the system so that users find it easy to borrow books!"
"Hi ipusnas, why every time I open the application, I can't? There is an inscription ""unable to retrieve data""and can't enter.How to solve it?"
"The application is very good, the library is at hand, but why when I don't open this application I get 2 problems, 1. When I don't open the application maybe more than 1 day I am suddenly told to enter again, 2. The same thing when I don't opened the application but logged in, why did my open loan suddenly not exist, please explain! Thank you"
"After borrowing 4 books, you want to borrow again, you can't always get an error"
"Targeted books are often lined up.. why should it be limited, right? This is an ebook that can be unlimited"
Very good.
Able to.
"I don't know how to use it, if you have one, please let me know"
"good, but needs to be improved a lot. the appearance must also be more attractive like today so that people are comfortable using it"
"I tried the next day, no error. Suggestions, please improve so that there are no frequent errors in the application. I have never been able to register before, it keeps failing. Even though this application is very good, many good books if you buy it at gr*med*a are expensive, but in this application we can read them for free. Not many people know about this application, so Indonesian literacy is still low"
"How come the application can't, min?"
Really good
"As for the book, please improve it again, but so far it's been pretty good.. there are many history books that can be read like Prof. Peter Carey üëçüèª For the system, it can be improved again so it doesn't take long to load"
"good, it's good to add a book reference"
It's a shame that the writings in these online library books are not accompanied by illustrations that can increase people's interest in reading
"The application is actually good, a few days ago I was still able to borrow and return books, but today it's difficult to borrow books, they said there was a problem because there were no hold items even to an ""unknow error"", even though my internet signal was stable and good, please hurry up fixed it, because there are several books that I'm looking for and when I want to borrow it, there are always problems. Thank you"
Never managed to borrow a book even though the queue was 0
Why does it keep getting errors when I want to register
"hello, please, it's easier to login, I want to log in but it keeps getting errors"
the error continues not clear
"Why after the update is it often difficult to borrow books? Please fix it immediately, oh yes, add a search history feature, yes, to make it easier for me to find books"
"Even though I used to like reading on iPusnas, why can't I login now?"
"Why does an error always occur when registering an email, even though the email and password are correct?"
"Every time I log in to this apk, how come it doesn't work, starting from email and then using fb it still doesn't work. Even though it's already a membership list. How about you even though you really need it."
"The Ipusnas is in error, isn't it? Please fix it immediately because I can't log in anymore and can't borrow books"
"On my cellphone there is an error, it says data not found. Even though I'm logged in and the network is good. Please fix it again"
The book is incomplete and looks very interesting
"When I want to borrow a book, the error keeps popping up, even though the connection is good"
Can't borrow books. Is it a problem?
"Every time I want to borrow, an unknown error always appears. It's a shame, even though an app like this is what people need now instead of having to use illegal methods. Please fix."
Good hope it's useful
good
How come the latest Ipusnas can't be screenshot...
"Hello ipusnas, I want to ask why when I enter my pasworld it must say ""password doesn't match"" Please answer yes..."
thank you for facilitating us to read
Excellent
Very nice
"The app is good, but it should be improved. Because there are still book titles that are not in the search, also add the capacity of the book so that readers don't have to queue up to borrow. Thank you"
"Hopefully this application can fulfill my reading interest, who used to go to the Pusda often, but because I was busy and rarely visited the Pusda, I hope that by downloading Ipusnas it will be cured, I miss reading more books, to be honest, I know the application from Tere Liye's post which is viral, ,,,"
"Please make a special column for books by the same author so that it's easy to find them, and also make a ranking of books (especially novels) every month or at least every year, thank you"
"Please provide a bookmark feature in the search field section to make it easier for us to mark certain authors that we want to read, as well as sections in books. Then, please increase the number of translated novels and make it easier to search for novels, because I really like reading these novels. One more thing, please make a monthly recommendation list for best-selling books. Greetings literacy"
"For the search field, why is it that every time I search for a book I can't find it, please, why? There is no stock of the book, is there a problem? :(((((("
"iPusnas is a really good application to get good & quality reading. However, some of the features are still incomplete and uneven. Also the collection of readings please be reproduced again. And please for the next update add a dark mode so that it is comfortable to use for reading in low light conditions. Thank you, hopefully iPusnas can continue to develop to be even better."
It's too complicated when logging in or even when you want to read a book

"It's really good to make it easier for children who like to read but unfortunately the stock is limited, so you have to wait for his work to be tere liye, please read this feedback, bro, so that it will be added later, but this apk is still very popular"
Very satisfactory
"In my opinion, please add a wishlist feature to save E-books that you want to read next (so it's not hard to search anymore)."
"Hi, thanks for making this great app. But can you add an update for the option to enlarge the view in the book, because my parents have trouble reading books in this application because of the small writing. Regards."
"I ask for help so that this application does not only have a smartphone, iPhone, PC and tablet version. I want this application to also be enjoyed by the hardware version of the Sony Bravia 4k GB ATV3 flat screen TV"
"I downloaded this Apk because there are fathers who are angry, thank you, Mr. who are angry, to be honest, this apk is good and quite complete, some of the books that I am looking for are also available even though the queue is very long #pakenadacoki"
"Many pages are turned upside down, pages have to be scrolled manually so it takes time, especially if the book has hundreds of pages, if you can add a word search feature so that looking for references for scientific works is easier and you don't have to read 1 chapter first to get the right one, and there are still many applications Another drawback is that the application seems as if it exists, without a well-organized user interface, please receive more feedback from users and implement it, don't worry, it's only 3 stars, there's no change."
"Why is the government-owned application like this, there are many errors, it's funny, the class of the country is not clear, do you not have the funds for a quality application, or maybe it's okay"
Shame shame
miss...
"It's a bit difficult to use, it often gets stuck, but at least it's better than buying pirated books."
"It's bad, I've downloaded it but can't enter. How's this. Even though the internet connection is also smooth, why is this being told to close the apk continuously. Do you really mean it?"
Very good
"Hello, sorry, I'm giving 1 star. The problem is that I have downloaded the app twice and deleted it again, when I want to open it, I always can't. Was told to try again because there is no DLS?? Please help, iPusnas team, thank you"
"Just downloaded this application because I want to increase interest in re-reading. Found out about this app after reading an article that ran the news of Tere Liye's anger over piracy behavior! I agree that the act of piracy is an act that harms many parties. Therefore, let's read books for free through Ipusnas. Or learn to save and buy the book you want! Spirit!!"
"The application often crashes, can't be opened. There is a notification ""An error occurred, could not retrieve data from the server"". Please improve the quality, e-library should help facilitate literacy, not make it difficult"
very fun.. heaven for book lovers with a mediocre budget..üòä. Continuing to improve the quality...
"I've tried to open the settings on the cellphone, the notification is already on, but why doesn't the notification appear in the notification bar? so you have to open the notification feature on ipusnas before you can see it. So I've been queuing for books since yesterday, but I can't get them"
Just installed but when I open the application it can't be opened?
Ah good
"Great app! Only one, the notification never came. So if the book I'm waiting for is available, there's no notification. Sometimes it feels like it's not fast enough, even though it's only been a few seconds after it's available. The rest is cool ipusnas"
"The application is very helpful, my suggestion is to have a preview of the book, so before we borrow the book, we can first see the table of contents of the book."
"How come the government-made applications are of this quality, it's a shame"
"How come the application can't log in, huh, üôèüèª"
Ô∏è
I hope it's always good....
Why does it keep getting errors when I open it? Can't get into it. It's hard to open
I propose to add a notification when the queued book can be borrowed... Sometimes there are no notifications so the book you want to borrow is often missed
Please expand the collection.
"Very much in borrowing books, one way to educate the nation's life"
"try to install because the talk is tere liye. Why is the library for political purposes? regret installing this. it's better to be pirated, the literacy is wider"
"We are not ready for e-library yet. As I expected, it must be very boring and often have problems with the apk. Instead of just having an apk, you don't take it seriously, it's better to just close it. Embarrass yourself. You don't try to improve yourself and you don't intend to improve yourself. Very bad."
Why can't I open the app?
"I downloaded this application May 22, 2021 and really like this application.. Many good books are interesting to read and add insight. But one (1) that I'm confused about, how to return it, huh? I borrowed 5,, I finished 2,, but when I wanted to return it, there was an explanation, it can only be returned after 1x24 hours,, today, May 24 (khan, it's been 2 days)??? The limit for borrowing books, how many books is the limit? Thank you"
The app is really good. Thanks
"Shalom. Sis, I'm sorry that I gave a rating of only 2. This is because I don't use the apk. After I downloaded and tried to use it. I don't know why I can't open this apk. Always told to close or try again. I've downloaded 2/3 times but still can't use it. Please fix the apk bro"
Okayee
"It's so bad, I can't open the apk, it always fails!!"
Thank you for presenting this application.
"how come, I can't register please help, add to the collection of fairy tales"
Very good
"I like it, overall it's enough. Great, please develop again"
I can't enter
Nice
Good For Searching Books For Free Like Usual Libraries But This Is Virtual.Thanksüôè
Please make a feature to adjust the font size. urgent.
It's hard to login :( I'll fix the stars when I can
Cool
I once downloaded this application in 2019. I don't know why the version was better that year.
"Why is it that every book that uses epub format, the bookmarks don't work? Why???"
"the book is not complete huh, why?"
"It turns out that entering via fb is difficult, it's easier to enter via email"
"The book library is complete, so you can save money so you don't buy books that don't match your college major. The application is also simple, not complicated to learn"
"Sorry, why is it that when I download the apk and want to open it, it can't be opened, and it says ""Can't retrieve data from server and no DLS,"" What does that mean?"
"the application is really good, recommended for those who want to read books without having to buy mwehehehe^^ just a suggestion to add more novels to the collection"
"Very useful, but if possible, please add more digital collections to support the work of academics like usüôè"
"I personally want to say thank you very much for the IPusnas application, also for the good books that can be borrowed at IPusnas, all of them are amazing, I can read without having to pay for buying books, thank God, hopefully IPusnas remains stable and can be accessed by many users. Thank you very much IPusnas, very helpful."
I'm only here to read Tere Liye's book AHAHHAHA
"The books are quite complete, how to borrow is also easy, but sometimes you have to be patient in line... Yes, the name is also free. Overall very satisfying."
"Why does it always fail when I want to borrow a book, please fix it, I'll give it 5 stars when I borrow it and can read it"
"Thanks to the developers and everyone involved in this app. I really enjoyed it. With this application I can easily channel my hobby, namely reading. Some books I can't buy, I can read some here. Not only that, there are many reference books for journaling, not too many in number but maybe enough. So far, no problems. And hopefully not."
"I really like this application. For advice, I hope there are more features added after borrowing books, history, and queues on the shelves. This feature can be used to store or collect the titles of the books we want to read, but not to borrow (wishlists). Because sometimes we find new books, but the books we have borrowed have not been read. This is so that the books do not pile up on the borrowing shelves without being read, only extended and also make it easier to find the book."
"This application is less stable, even though the class is the central government. The UI is not friendly and there are many errors. Hope it gets fixed soon"
"Sorry, it was good at first but lately it's getting a lot of errors. When you want to borrow a book, the app suddenly stops. Please fix"
"It's pretty good, but there are some drawbacks that I think can be improved, one of which is that the loading time of content is long enough to fix even though the internet signal is quite smooth"
"Thank you for the fast response, the book can be borrowed. thank you again"
"Alhamdulillah, the application is great, thank you for making this very useful application :))"
good for adding literature
"It's very useful, so you don't need to come to the library to read"". Hopefully the application will always have better development. The download must have a lot of packages, then you can suggest using wefi if you download it fast"
"You can only borrow 5 books per day, right? What if you want to return it? A bit confused"
Excellent
Very good
many obstacles
Apk is very ok
There are some books that can't be downloaded even though previously they could. Errors and maintenance continue to be the reason. games of thrones book 2 can't be downloaded. please help.
Enough
"Because I didn't read the reviews before downloading it, I downloaded this Apk, I regret downloading this Apk! This Apk when I touch the ""Borrow"" button Always Fails! Says I haven't done Email Verification What does this mean!? Ipusnas admin please explain what it means! I just downloaded it yesterday May 17, 2021 Until now (May 18) I have not been able to borrow a book If I can borrow a book I promise to give 5 stars"
Excellent
"why can't i log in...... the error is mulu, I've installed and uninstalled several times."
"So far so good, no need to buy any more books"
"Why do you have to use a borrowed system before you can read, can you not make it read directly, that way the server is not heavy right, with the direct reading method it can make it easier for readers and there is a big possibility that you can increase your willingness to read in our country because there are conveniences there.."
"I'm sorry, why is iPusnas now like it's not being taken care of? Very heavy when opened. Defeated badly by iJabar and the application made by PT Woolu Aksara Maya. Light. Should iPusnas be handed over or managed by Woolu Aksara Maya? Hopefully so."
"I really like the app, rarely get errors. Maybe in the future you can just change the appearance"
harry potter dong ):
"Hi I, pusnas, ask for help, please tell the government to be more serious about making this useful application"
"Apks often have errors, searches often don't match, sometimes the results are there, sometimes not, the scope of the collection field is not much. Suggestions to increase the collection, especially the library field, it is better if the search feature is more specific, for example by searching by title, author and sentence in the book, the color of the search symbol is brighter, and there is a feature to read books without borrowing."
"please fix the app. bugs often occur when reading books, the writing is not visible. only white paper. 5x download fails continuously even though the internet connection is fast. please update soon. the application is good, apart from the complaints above"
"Is this application also affected by the pandemic? Every time it is opened, it always takes a long time to load and it is not easy to borrow books. In maintenance condition he said. Ô∏è"
Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
"Min, how do you find words in a book, how do you do that, bro? Or does this feature not exist yet? If it's not there please add min because this search feature is very very useful and saves time, thank you"
"Indonesian language content, the application is made by the Indonesian government, but the interface menu (UI) is still mixed with English rojak/gado-gado. It's even weird."
"The application is back as it was, thank you :)"
"Good, only if the new books are not available. The book isn't complete. Hopefully it can be added to a collection of other good books"
"This application is very helpful, especially for me as a student who needs a lot of books to reference my assignments.. this application is also equipped with many books, but unfortunately it is not very complete. ."
Very helpful
"Why can't I borrow a book, there must be something written, you haven't verified the e-mail even though I opened the e-mail, there's no notification from Ipusnas, please admin, fix it... it's useless I downloaded it but I can't borrow it"
Thank you üôèüôèüôè
Always dls error
"So far, the digital library application like this is very helpful, especially for me, who in fact is a final year student and really needs to look for book references ""to complete my final project in the midst of a pandemic like this. can't borrow a book. Please also increase the collection & stock of books, because indeed we students need a lot of stock of books to read and so that other friends can read them."
"This application is great for adding insight without having to spend money to buy books. But unfortunately many features have errors (cannot be used) for example the word search feature when reading, even though it is very helpful for finding keywords in an electronic book"
Thank you Can read some books that can not be bought. Hopefully the collection will increase.
"Admin, please add more collections and copies of books related to research methods."
"It's a shame, the more you come here, the more frequent the errors, not to mention the increasing queues. Honestly, I really miss the state of Ipusnas in 2018-2019, which didn't have long queues because few people knew about it and the errors weren't too frequent. Sir/Madam, more and more people are aware of the Ipusnas application, there should be a policy regarding very long queues that can even reach thousands, even though there are only a dozen or less books in stock."
"Every time I want to borrow a book, it's an error"
"The app is pretty good, but it can be added like a favorite book and a book to read later. Sometimes I accidentally stumble upon a good book but forget the title. So if there is a ""read later"" feature, it's easier"
"Nikolai Gogol's book - Dead souls cannot be borrowed, please repair itüôèüèª"
"Hopefully with this application, it can make Indonesia a reading culture"
"edit: okay, that's correct, so far it can be used, the books are okay, and free! thank youu"
"Min, is there an error in the application?"
The system keeps getting errors
Why is there an error when I open it hmm?
THE NOVEL IS OLD! THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO READ IPUSNAS
Frequent errors
Please fix it even more so that there is no interference
Nice app
"What is the urgency of needing camera permission? If it's not a key function, it's better to make it an option, not a mandatory one. Epurpusdikbud can follow. Thank you for the previous answerüôè"
Borrowing books always fails
There are a lot of errors... how are you smart Indonesian children if the application to increase knowledge has many errors...
"I often do maintenance, sometimes more than a day :(... please fix itüôè"
"It's been a few days, how come the application is not good yet? Please fix it immediately, OK, Sis. It's sad that I can't borrow books."
Ipusnas please add books by Pramoedya
"Hi ipunas, your application was very helpful in working on the report, but now there is a problem after I installed it, when I borrowed a book, I couldn't enter the book but left the application, I hope the ipunas application can be repaired again so that it can be used comfortably. I reduced it because it was unstable, it took so long to load, I can't even enter search"
"The application often maintains, likes to suddenly logout. Please fix."
"Sorry, the iPusnas team, why have they been doing maintenance lately?"
Awesome app
Helpfulüëç
"This application is very useful for finding literacy in doing assignments, but the book pages that are displayed are not very complete, hopefully the collection can be added again so that it can make it easier for literacy seekers, thank you"
"Thank God there's no maintenance anymore, hopefully in the future it will be like this so that it can be more useful for looking for references for college assignments."
"Thank God, now this application can be used again to borrow books. Suggestion: Please upgrade the display to a modern view so that it is pleasant to look at and the books presented are reproduced because sometimes I can't find the book I'm looking for..."
Finally the system is getting better.. Thank you ipusnas.. Please add the book collection...
üëç
"Thank you, because I have been able to access the book again, I give it 5 stars. The application is really good and very helpful, but don't make mistakes again üôè"
Please see.. what is the damage
"Does anyone know why every time I want to return a book I've borrowed for 2 days, I can't, right? Thank you for the developers who have developed this library, this application is perfect for being a reference. Very suitable for use by students, both intermediate to upper levels."
"Thank you for the improvement üòä keep up the spirit and if you can add more translated ebook novels, especially the series ones"
Thank you to the entire ipusnas team for providing the best service. Hopefully the application and server will always be stable.
Satisfied many books are available here.
"Often has problems... want to borrow books, it keeps failing, unknown errors, maintenance for days, even though I carry the name of the country/national... Ipusnas is back to normal, hopefully the service and security can continue to be maintained, Ipusnas has a country, time to lose with personal/company applications"
iPusnas is very helpful in increasing knowledge and its collection of thousands of books can be read for free. Hope to improve the stability of the server again.
"Ipusnas.. why can't I borrow books.. Please fix the application.. always error when borrowing.. it's been a few days that I can't borrow books.. please fix the application, please..."
"Last year was still okay. Errors are very rare The last few months have been getting errors. Even though this apk is really good for education, especially so that young people who like to read don't download or read from pirated ebooks. There should be a government apk class with a quick response considering there have been many complaints from the public"
"I used to want easy downloads, now I want to download the maintence server first. Even though I want to find an important book. Please fix it quickly because many students like us need references from many books and are limited to buying books"
Inspirational
"There is always a maintenance post every time you want to borrow a book. I hope it's back to normal soon, app'y"
Library but can't borrow. I even made a new account still can't. Whereas before it could. Please fix.
Why do I always get an error every time I want to borrow a book?
"This application is very helpful in increasing literacy access for the public. However, lately it seems the server is having problems. Please fix it immediately, why does the maintenance continue... Huhuhu"
This app has been with me for a long time. So please don't let me delete itü§ó. It's been a few days since I have been able to download the book but there is no notification at all from the admin
"Give three stars first, because there are so many errors. It's been an error since yesterday, so I can't borrow books. But thank you for providing books for free but legal."
"Lately there's been frequent maintenance or server errors, please fix it because this application is very helpful"
"The application cannot be used on a laptop or on a cellphone, nothing appears. And can't log in."
"It's a very good and very useful application, but sometimes it often crashes, so I can't borrow books."
", I often do maintenance, maintenance is usually one day but today is a bit longer (more than 2 days), I give 5 stars, other friends please give 5 stars, even though maintenance, because applications like this should be appreciated, not dance dance applications, we should appreciate it with 5 stars, thank you for your attention"
"I am very grateful for this application, because it makes it very easy for me to find references when doing college assignments, hopefully iPusnas will be more advanced and synergize in educating the nation"
"Please fix it immediately, because I've been wanting to borrow a book for a few days, it always fails, unknown errors and often says ""Failed. You don't have a hold item."". I've re-login and reinstalled the apk but still can't borrow. Even though it was never like this before. Thank youüôè"
Frequent errors...
I gave it a sati star not because this app is bad. But because of the frequent occurrence of errors and maintenance even in a day can be many times. Please admin fix. This application is very good and can brighten the literacy life of the nation's children. It's a shame if there are frequent errors.
"I don't know, it's getting here, the application is getting worse. Even though the first time I downloaded it, it wasn't like this. I can do maintenance many times a day, even in 2 days I can't borrow books, the server keeps getting errors, I've tried many times but it doesn't work. It's frustrating. Please fix the application"
"Why is it that maintenance is first-time, unknown error, it says that Indonesia is an emergency reading, if this is an application, that's normal, people want to read it, but an application of this model is given, not once or twice, maintenance doesn't finish... if it can't be used, publish it to users, if the application can't be used again, so we don't install it either. Wherever the maintenance is, it's a matter of days, this is monthly, often too... where the stock of books never increases.."
Can't open the data and there's no DLS
"Assalamu'alaikum Brother, I'm asking, sis, how come the application has been error since yesterday morning until now, how is it, sis? Because the application is very helpful for those of us who need references in writing, sis. What's the solution bro?"
Don't get distracted often

"Hello Ipusnas, I have enjoyed this application for two weeks. After that, you can never borrow anything again. The information given is that the server is under maintenance. Is the maintenance period for days?"
"You can read as many novels as you want >< I want a suggestion, if you can, search for the publisher. Like spans, grammar, noura, etc."
"I gave 2 stars not because the apk is not good, but why since yesterday the server has been error and maintenance has continued, please consistent improvements so that it can make it easier for people who use this apk, please fix it üôè"
"Ipusnas, please fix the application, I can't read books because the application continues to maintain. It's been a while since Ipusnas was like this"
This is why the app can't borrow books. it's been a few days. please fix it. because I really need the book. thanks.

apk problem.? Question: Can't borrow a book
"In the beginning there were no problems in borrowing books. Next server error, maintenance for days. What is this ?!"
"The error is serious, how does this nation want to be smart if the e-library is not noticed at all, there is no significant development, even the Tiktok application continues to grow, which can damage this nation."
"I like this application, but lately why is it getting errors when borrowing books? Please provide a solution.. Please cover the lack, boost the excess. Regards."
maintenance is very long
"Please, why is this application, I want to borrow a book, it keeps failing,"
"Hello, the application is very good and useful, I really recommend it for those who like to read, but by the way, why can't my account borrow books?"
"The first time the download was fine, borrowing the book was also easy. But when I tried the second time to borrow another book, the application had an error like that. So it's slow and everything can't be opened even though the network and the quota are safe. Please improve the quality again, bro. Thank you.."
"I'll reduce the star first, because I can't borrow books"
Keep it up
Why can't the book be borrowed lately???
"Please really, I still need to make thesis reference material, the application is actually maintenance -_-"
Applications love Maintenance. Very unpleasant I hope the application can be improved again
"A very useful application because many books are available and borrowed for free. But, today I want to borrow a book, I can't because of a server problem, hopefully it will be fixed soon"
"Sorry sir, how come I can't borrow books. Every time you want to borrow, there must be an unknown error written. Please help üôè"

Like
"Continued maintenance. Even though the national application, it should not be inferior to the private one. duh"
"hi, this apk is good but sorry in advance. When I wanted to return the book, I pressed agree, but how come the book is still there? It doesn't come back, it's still on the bookshelf. Well, I haven't returned the book because of this problem. Please fix it :), when it was fixed, I said, so I can return the book, because I've tried several times, but I can't."
"Failed to add book in collection, unknown error. These three days it was always like that when I wanted to borrow a book."
"I really like this app, but how come it's been a few days since I can't borrow a book?"
"This application is very good, I really like it because I can read books anywhere. But why in the last two days I can't add books to the shelf and also can't return books that have been borrowed, huh? I beg your help"
The book loan keeps failing
"The screen display is okay, easy to use. Please make more references to the book. I want to borrow it, why did it fail even though there are still 6 copies?"
"Why is it that when I want to add it to the ebook, it can't always be written like this ""failed to add book to collection, unknown error"" if it can be fixed again"
Frequent errors >_<
"Actually, this application is really good, but I don't understand why when I want to borrow some books the queue is already long, it keeps getting errors. Hopefully it can be fixed soon."
"Hello.. Since downloading this application I feel happy because I can read without having to carry a book, but these 2 days I have had problems borrowing books because it always fails for unknown reasons. Is it the application or what?"
"I like to read in this app, the books are complete. It's just a shame, the frequency of errors is not comfortable. In fact, I've upgraded, so I reinstalled it so I don't get errors when borrowing books. Please, this kind of problem is fixed again for the convenience of users."
"Regret downloading, can't borrow/read books. Poor!"
Why Ipusnas can't borrow books anymore?? Unknown error
Why doesn't the server maintain maintenance at night?
"It can't be used at all, it says the server is under maintenance"
"The application is good and very helpful, but when I want to borrow again, it keeps saying the maintance server"
"The collection of books is truly extraordinary. Please increase the number of books that are often in the queue. Today there is a server error notification, failed to borrow a book"
Good for those who like to read
Why is it now that every time I want to borrow a book I can't? The unknown error notification always appears. Explanation please. Thank you
Can't borrow books
"Actually this apk is really good for looking for references, it's just that there are so many errors"
Why can't you borrow a book from yesterday?
"Hello, please let me know if Ipusnas is having trouble... is it possible to start borrowing books from now on?"
"I really like this apk, the features are complete and easy. But why do I want to borrow a book, I can't and it always shows that the server is in maintance. Please fix it again, because this apk is needed by many people. Thank you"
"I am a new user of ipusnas. I want to ask, if when you want to borrow a book you can't add it (error), why is that?"
"it used to be good why now it's not good, I can't download anymore even though I want to read a book :( it always fails when I want to download"
"Sorry, this is the server, what's wrong? I want to try to download a book that has a lot of stock but can't. Server maintenance or something... Please respond"
"Hello, this application is very useful but the last few days I can't borrow books, is the application having problems?"
"1 star not because g is good. But so that my advice is read. Please the application is more stable, the maintenance is very frequent, even 1 day can be repeated many times. Search keywords sometimes like to display things that don't match. And the book recommendations are really not based on the history of the loan. But it's a book that I want to highlight. I have never borrowed or searched about politics. But what always appears is related to the state administration executive."
Keep failing
"Please update. This application must be developed continuously, add interesting features such as dark mode, choice of themes, jump pages with options, and multiply books published by well-known publishers such as Gramedia. And, please extend the borrowing time of the book. It is impossible, for example, a user to borrow more than two books, and it can be finished for 5 days. This in addition to reducing the fun of reading, also makes reading hang or not all finished."
"I'm a new iPusnas user, when I want to borrow a book but can't continue, what's the solution bro?üôè"
"Already min. I've tried that way but every time I click ""reset password"" it says ""data not valid"""
"This is the second time I've given one star, it's failed before, but if you want to borrow me, it always shows an unknown error notification, or there is a problem with the network, my network is stable, I can even download videos, please fix the application immediately, I still need the book or not can borrow a book"
"Hello, sorry beforehand, the application is really good. The books you are looking for happen to always be there... But why can't I download the book lately huh?"
"In the class of a national library, the collection of e-books is not complete, right? Look for the title of the book, what title came out. Disappointing."
Excellent
"So far, ipusnas is an online library with a fairly complete collection of books. However, the apk error more often. Suggestion: It is recommended that the maintenance schedule be announced on the homepage."
Useful apps
"It's great for finding motivational books, business study books, etc., but maybe the borrowing time is a bit longer :( the collection is even more complete"
"Thank you for the response, the solution patent worked.. I give it five stars..."
Excellent. Very helpful
"Hello admin, please add a collection of books from legal disciplines, it will be very helpful for law students like me, in improving legal literacy, thank you."
"There are many types of books, complete, and many of the latest books as well. The application is very helpful and can fill your spare time! Anyway, thank you very much to the ladies and gentlemen who have made this applicationüåπ - advice: please add the wishlist feature and add a way to cancel a book from the queue."
Improve literacy
"In my opinion, the book is incomplete, let alone a book for students"
"How come I can't log in, please, this is a really good apk"
Very good I like more work
INDEPENDENT
"Hello, the application is very good and useful. However, I would like to suggest adding a feature like ""wishlist"". Because there are times when the daily loan quota runs out, but I found a good book to borrow. Thank you, hopefully this application can continue to grow."
"Actually this application is good and very useful. However, there are still problems, such as when the borrowing arrives, the error page arrives, and returns to the previous page. This happens repeatedly. Hopefully it can be fixed and become better üëç"
"Everything is very good, it's just that the font for reading is small and can't be adjusted so that it hurts the eyes if you read for a long time, I hereby request that it can be fixed üôè"
"Why should there be a schedule borrowed by other people, does Indonesia intend to educate its nation or not, why are people limited to reading? It's up to you to innovate digital libraries, see abroad, free downloads of books, even if they are expensive, it's just the intention to educate, just make it annoying. It's useless that there are good innovations but the management is bad. Please if possible anytime everyone can access. The book is already digital, why are there limits? The system period is the same as a physical book, isn't it weird!"
"It's very useful to read books anywhere and anytime, easy access but some people have to queue first... but overall it's very good and good"
"Why is it that every time I want to borrow a book it always says ""You haven't verified your email"" I've tried sending it again. There has been a notification that has been sent to the user. I'm trying to borrow. But it appears again that there is no email verification yet. How is that. Please help."
I like reading books because hehe
Thank you ipusnas... this application really helped me get quality reading while living a minimalist and zero waste life. Please add more to the collection.
"There are not many copies, and the books are incomplete. For example, Andrea Hirata's novels, there are only Ayah novels, while the others don't exist."
Well
"Thank God. I am happy with this application. This application is very helpful, especially for people who can't afford to buy books or during this pandemic. Unfortunately, it needs some improvements to make it easier to use. The app is often slow and the search results don't match. If the search is like this, I often get annoyed when I scroll through the search results and don't find what I want. Please fix it, ok? Thank you very much, greetings literacy^^"
"The apk is good, especially for students. Hopefully in the future iPusnas can provide even better services. Greetings literacy..üòÇüòÇ"
"Min now the appearance has changed huh?? So I can't bookmark, then there's no page description. Is that so???"
The books are still lacking.. the search doesn't match what you're looking for..
Bereh
"Admin, please upgrade the app. Frequent errors.. the question is why before we install the app there must be permission to change system settings? The system from our cellphone? If it's true that our system access is quite easy, it's easy to browse"
"Very good,"
"please add a black paper skin so it doesn't damage your eyes when reading in a dark place, thank you"
"Sorry for developers, I want to send input.. For what book stock can be reproduced? There are many of our friends who want to read and have to queue for a long time. When we look back at the reasons for ""development of knowledge in Indonesian society"" The number of books that can be borrowed and the long queue of books will be one of the obstacles to the development of that knowledge. Thank you"
The app is really good!
"Dear sir, ma'am. I just want to say this.. How come the login took so long huh.. I've been waiting for it to roll around here and there, but it's not finished.. Btw, this is a national library application, so if apart from textbooks, is there anything else? books such as novels, short stories or whatever? Please reply.. üòäüòÇüôèü§ó"
"Min, please increase the stock for books that have a lot of readers, the queues are up to thousands of people. And please add a wishlist feature, so if for example we accidentally see a book (there are lots of stock) and want to borrow but we still have a lot of reading, we won't forget/lose track of the book. Thank you~"
"Why do you always force close, when you finish borrowing a book and the book is about to be opened, the application always forces close (Ipusnas keeps stopping)"
"Can't retrieve data from server. No DSL. What do you mean, admin, before now I can't read the book anymore"
please multiply the books often run out of grandiose and also increase the search list so that it is easy to find
"The apk is very good and very helpful, but there are times when you want to borrow a book, you can't always get an error even though there are still many books like economics and finance books: the meaning of Islamic economics by syafruddin prawiranegara, I have tried to borrow the book many times but it keeps getting errors even though I need it its a great book. Please help and please fix it."
"The application cannot be opened, error. Please fix it soon.."
"Is there a problem with the application or my cellphone is not worth it? Every time I want to borrow a book I can't get it on the shelf, it always fails, why? Edit: after a long wait it's finally okay."
Love itüòç
mangtabbzz
"Sorry, this is the apk, yesterday I tried to download it for the first time, after it was finished, I clicked, how come it doesn't work? Are there any improvements regarding the application? Please explain, thank you"
"Please cancel the queue, Sis, so that notifications don't pile up and mix with the really awaited book"
It's stable again
I can not login
"This application is really good, it's just that it likes errors, maybe because of the maintance so that it interferes with the comfort of reading, hopefully in the future it can minimize the errors... Success for Ipusnas"
"Thank you iPusnas. Your presence is very helpful during a pandemic like this, especially for students who can't go to the library but need references to do assignments"
"Please upgrade the application. Slow times and frequent errors like this. The search algorithm is also not precise, the search results displayed are not relevant to our search sentence. I just tried EPerpusdikbud, so far EPerpusdikbud is superior in UI/UX design, I just need to add to the collection of books so I don't lose to the collection of iPusnas"
"The application is good, complete and in my opinion comfortable, the best thing is üëç"
Excellent
"It's so bad.. the error keeps going.. if you're interested, don't you give a free book.. or I'll just look for a pirated one"
Very nice
"Why can't when I download it, I can't enter üôèüôè"
The application is good..a lot of books that can be read..but unfortunately the apk.likes an error.....
"A pretty good application to increase emotions, please fix it yesterday when I wanted to borrow a book I couldn't, now the book can be borrowed instead it can't be opened and forced close"
"Can't connect to the server, wkkwkwkw it's really funny to develop"
"Thank you for always answering, Ipusnas always accompanies me in my spare time, so I always feel lacking when the application suddenly goes wrong like this. Cheers to devs. And also please, the book PUBLIC ECONOMICS by Drs. M. Suparmoko, it was held at Ipusnas, I couldn't find it since yesterday"
"It's really sad, I really need this apk for work, it keeps getting errors please, let's fix the apk immediately. This is very important, otherwise the value is empty"
Can't open
"Very useful application, and many books that I have been looking for. but why do I want to open the application again, it always appears there is no LDS, please.... Fixed it. I like this application, it adds insight, especially students, so it's easier to find assignment materials, thank you."
I just downloaded . But why can't it be opened?
"an error occurred, unable to retrieve data from server and no DLS. close the app?"
I just downloaded this apk. Why can't it be opened?
"Hello, my application has an error, please fix it, thank you :)"
toooopppp
"There are so many errors, I don't know where the budget was made Ô∏è"
Can't open
"The more you come here, the more errors"
Uyy
"good, but now just maintenance? want to borrow a book can not happen."
"Please fix it, I want to borrow a scientific paper manual, I can't download it I'm depressed"
"I really need to borrow books, but it keeps failing because the server is often under maintenance. Ô∏è"
"A very helpful application if you want to read books but lack the funds to buy the original ones and don't want to read the illegal ones. Just a little advice, if the server maintenance doesn't take too long, okay? If you can get a notification that it's under maintenance and how long the maintenance will take, don't download the book you want to read when you know it's under maintenance."
ipusnas has just repaired the server. Disturb. Still cool to read though -_-
Why do I need to borrow the book for maintenance? And the book: Aristotle: The Ethics of Nikomakea POLITICS The poetry of Marcus Aurelius: Plato's Meditation: The Republic Please add it please.!!!
"Why does the application error, every time I want to download it always fails! ..."
"Why can't I download the book at all? It's always an unknown error, even though I've reinstalled it several times."
"How come my Ipusnas keeps on borrowing books, doesn't it? It says unknown error if it's not a zip file"
"Hello admin, why does ipusnas often get errors? Then why is the e-Library menu empty? If you want to find popular menus, it's filled with the characters' menus... Please put the e-library with the most collections at the front"
Why does the application often force closeüò≠üò≠üò≠
"Please fix it, I want to borrow a book but I can't"
Why is the apk error I can't download the book
"Improved again!! Even though it's good and more practical, but sometimes like distractions."
"It's hard to log in, wait all the time even though the network is good"
"It's great, almost all of the books are available, more on the stock of books, especially expert research books, so that they can help in the process of writing a thesis Ô∏è"
"The books are all finished, nothing can be read, disappointed"
"Good apps,, Suggestions if you can review the initial book in more detail so that readers know the book to be read,, The waitlist feature for books to make it easier to find books to read, Magazines / tabloids may be included in the catalog,,"
"Sorry Ipnunas, there are still errors, for example, when I borrow a book and I will open the book, it even exits the application itself, please fix it, thank you"
"The apk is good, but why is it often ""problem loading book"". Then when I'm searching, the book you're looking for doesn't appear, aka empty (there isn't any writing), please improve it again"
Sorry I gave a rating of 2. Because I just downloaded but the application can't be opened at all. Please help how is this? Always appears the sentence is not connected to the server and no DLS
How come the apk can't be installed
"Ah, I'm disappointed, how come the account that I could use 5 minutes ago immediately disappeared, I don't know where. It's so bad"
"Please fix the application as soon as possible, because when borrowing a book the application closes itself. Then in terms of good looks to be upgraded, recruit graphic design people so that the display is not boring. Come on, don't lose to compete with other applications, like the national library, but there are so many shortcomings. Recruit capable people."
"From the comments of other friends, I like it and I will try, hopefully it helps"
the book is quite complete
"Very helpful, thank you National Library"
"The application is very useful. However, there are a few things that bother me, namely: 1. The reading display is less friendly (unlike the Play Book and Kindle display). 2. It's even better if you put ""Screen On/Stay Awake"", so the screen doesn't dim while reading. Hopefully there will be an improvement soon. Always success iPusnas üôèüèºüëçüèº"
"Really good! Can read free and legal books, also go to the national library even though online (hopefully the pandemic will be over soon so I can go directly to the building, wow) I just have a suggestion, please complete the series, I like to meet a lot of books that aren't in one series, thank you üôèüèª"
Just installed it keeps getting errors and can't log in..
"The application is good, it's really nice to have an online library like this, because the usual library is far from home"
increase the book collection
Please add the latest book. It's a shame there are rarely books that are trending here.....
Mantappp
"the application is good but, it is very dangerous to ask for permission which can make our data leak"
"Hello iPusnas, what if I can't log in, whether it's using email or Facebook? Even though I really need a book reference at isPusna."
"The application is actually good, but lately it has been getting errors, I hope it can be fixed quickly. thank you"
good maybe i just tried
Very good
Why can't I login...
"It's really hard to borrow the apk, it's always down :( it's my turn to get it but the contents are blank :("
Maintenance tross!
"At first I really liked this application, but the longer it gets difficult to borrow books, the error keeps"
The maintenance takes too long.. I can't borrow books.
Very nice
"It's broken, the application keeps crashing, I can't read the book again"
"It's sad, it's an error even though this apk is the only hope for finding books. Hopefully it can be fixed."
"I want to borrow a book, but I can't, can I? Please fix, thank you üôè"
"Admin, how do I search for a book in the search field on the popular e-library page? Because I looked for a book on the main page but it wasn't there. Please, Admin. Please answer"
Thank you for presenting this great app. Suggestions in the future there is a wishlist feature and a page jump feature. I am not a wormbook but I am proud of the existence of this application. Thank you National Library. Greetings literacy
"This apk is actually very good and useful. Because there are always books we want to read, but we don't want to buy or we don't have money. This can be an alternative and legal way to pirated ebooks. However, as good as the apk is, there are still drawbacks. One of the drawbacks of this apk is that it often asks to log in. Sometimes it suddenly exits, then when you open it again, you have to log in first. Even though I never logged out. Tired of having to re-write email and passwords. To the developer, please fix it. Thank you"
All novels... Books on mace mechanical engineering
"Excellent. It's getting more and more difficult to borrow the book because you have to queue, but it shows an increasing number of readersüòÖ"
Why does this app need camera access and must be allowed to be able to change the system? Dig user data? Dig into user privacy?
good
why can't server data??
"Permissions ... ""allow applications to change system settings"" ... does not install deh"
"I really like this application, there are so many collections of books, for Ipusnas, thank you for making this application. Before I knew there was an online library, I was confused about where to borrow books, now I can read good books from home. Just a suggestion, I hope there will be a save and then borrow feature soon, because I sometimes find good books but I can't borrow them because of my borrowing limit T_T. Hopefully the bugs will rarely appear."
ok
Very nice
ok
"So far, I'm okay using this app. However, I've never received a notification from this app. Why? Hopefully in the future it can be better."
Sis this application is very good. But why did the account suddenly logout itself and then I logged in again had problems even though I was sure that my network was running at 5mbps. Hope it doesn't crash again
Very nice
Jose...
"Thank you very much, this application is very useful. But please add a favorite feature or read later for the next book to read."
Still bugs
"It's really hard to log in, even though the email and password are correct, logging in using Facebook takes a long time to load, even though the signal here is good"
Now I'm better at mastering this application. This app is cool. Very useful and instills a passion for reading.
Thank you ipusnas
can't open
Can not be used
"Min, how come the book I borrowed suddenly disappeared, then when I looked for stock again, 0, after that I couldn't access the server either"
"Recently, why has Ipusnas often had bugs?"
"There are still many bugs, today when I want to use it I can't because of server problems"
The application cannot be opened
"Why can't it be opened, I thought it was my cellphone that had a problem so I deleted it and re-downloaded it but after I re-downloaded it it still couldn't be opened, even though I really like this apk."
"Is there a problem with this app? Every time I want to borrow a book, I can't do it, even though it's really important."
"Frequent errors, please developers fix the bugs"
"Often have problems loading, even though the connection is stable, please fix it"
"Why can't I borrow a book lately, the details of the book are not included even though the network is already good. Again, it's difficult if you want to borrow a book, the network doesn't support it, even though the network is already good"
This is why the National Library is not very clear.
"I have been using this application for a long time, but when there is an update the application can't even be opened. Many books that I am currently reading and will be reading are even difficult to enter, even if there is no email verification, there is no response from the application. Please fix it then I will change the star. So that I can read freely and comfortably again. Thank you... Notes: if the application is running properly, I will change the stars."
The error is very frequent;(( please fix it min
Frequent errors
Thank you for your efforts to meet student needs‚ù§Ô∏è
"I really like this apk. Good and can access many digital books legally. Only now there are often apk errors. For example, you can't search or save books. Reading history also likes to be lost."
"It's crazy, at first I gave 4 stars, I deleted it because now I can't access anything, the writing is just sorry I can't retrieve data from the server, there is no DLS then force close the application. And tried it on another phone too. Ahhh so disappointed."
"Why is it that every time I want to open the Ipusnas application it always crashes, please help, I'm looking for references for my thesis üôèüôè"
Thank you for providing a digital library. It would be even better if the ipusnas application was also available on the microsoft store.
good
ok
Bagoos
Application cannot be opened. Error: unable to retrieve data from server and no DLS. Please fix
"Thank you for the very helpful application, but why can't you take screenshots anymore? Even though it's a useful feature for sharing knowledge"
"There are still frequent errors, unfortunately I also downloaded this from my mother's cellphone. It doesn't work on IOS Hp or laptop. Though the apps can be very useful. Please help"
"To the kindhearted Ipusnas, I am very grateful for this very useful application, really very useful. But I want to give input as a consumer of Ipusnas, please add the ""save"" and ""page info"" features to make it easier for readers, Ipusnas has many good books, so if we happen to get a good book that we haven't had time to read, it will be better if the ""save to read later"" feature is added. Or ""favorites"" can also, that's all, please."
"Please, if there is a fix or anything that makes the application temporarily inaccessible, let the user know first. Let's not think the application can't be used. Even though this app is pretty good. So I can only know the application is still being repaired or has been completed from the replies to the comments. New users will also not be confused about why the application can't be opened, not re-downloaded, and the reviews are a little better."
"This app is really good because there are a lot of reading books here! But lately, why is it so hard to find books in search, even if they don't exist, when in fact there are but they don't appear when you search :( like persona, happines, why is that?"
"Please admin, the borrowing time limit is not 3 days, it's not enough. I suggest 7 days / extended... thanks"
Please add the e-book
I just downloaded. May be useful
Very nice
"Many writings are missing (in pdf form), sometimes the books that appear on the homepage can't be found.. Hufttt, lazy lah"
"Please give a book suggestion feature, bro, so students can request books"
Can't enter
"A very useful apk, please update it to make it even better"
"Very bad application, difficult to register. There's no option. Suggestions for those of you who want to download, think about it, don't expect too much from this application."
"Very good, can borrow books for free. But I have a request so that the dev can add to his collection of books, for example novels. Like the book Tere Liye, Adara Kirana, also Pitsansi, and others. Especially the novels Comet Minor, Selena, Nebula, The White, Lumpu and others belonging to Tere Liye. I really hope there will be a Komet Minor novel, because the only available ones are Comet. I hope you will consider it, Dev. Thank you!"
"Bro, I can't enter the application... It says there's no server data and no DLS, what's wrong with that..?"
Hello iPusnas.... Permission to ask... Why can't I borrow a book when I want to? I've deleted it and re-downloaded it more than 2 times but I can't even borrow it... Please fix it as soon as possible... üôèüôèüôèüôè
"I'm very happy that this application exists. Making it easier for us to access many reading books from many genres that we want digitally. However, why is it often a nuisance now, huh? Every time I want to borrow a book, I fail. Uninstall and install it many times, what appears instead is the statement ""Unable to retrieve data from server and no DLS'. Why is that, huh?"
Why is it so difficult to use this application? The writing has problems finding the category books and can't even open the book
"Hello developer, Thank you for making this application. Very helpful for students in writing papers. The books provided are also quite complete. It's just that 1-2 days there is a status problem loading... unknown error, and can't open a book, borrow a book. Whereas previously there was no problem. I wonder why?"
Why is the apk difficult to access?
"I've installed it but when I open it it says DLS isn't there, why isn't it?"
"It's been two days since the connection time out, even though the internet network is fast"
"This is why you can't borrow, minn? For college assignments, it's very important, please fix it min"
Can't be installed
Why can't I log in??? What's wrong with ipusnas??? So disappointing
"Please fix the application, because it's always a nuisance. Honestly, I feel disturbed when I want to study with books that cannot be borrowed because of application errors."
"Very helpful application for finding references. But lately, how come there are often errors, I want to borrow the book, I just get an error. Please improve the service again, I really need to find a reference for my thesis. Please fix it soon üôèüèª"
"Good, I hope there will be more collections of books and there will be no errors hehe"
"Hello. I can't open Ipusnas, why? It always says ""no DLS."" What do you mean?"
Why can't the book be downloaded?
"It's often very difficult to get an error wanting to borrow a book, even though this application is very helpful. But why does the error problem when borrowing occur so often I hope it will be fixed quickly, so that users feel comfortable with this application Thank you"
Why can't my Ipusnas be opened since last night? Is it under repair?
"Hello Min, why can't the book be downloaded, even though I'm using wifi"
"Developers please fix the bug, it's a shame this good app doesn't work anymore. It's been a few weeks since I opened it and looked for a book, but it takes a long time to load and I can't open the book"
"I can't login, always error"
"how come the application often has errors, especially for the android. for PC it still works, although more often it doesn't :("
"Sometimes when borrowing a book it is difficult to open even though it has been downloaded. Or the stock of books is still available, but it says, ""There is no ePustaka that provides this book"", even though some time ago it could be downloaded, opened, and read. The position of the internet network is good, and coincidentally my friend who opened Ipusnas also had the same difficulty. Please fix it, so that it is more useful for users. iPusnas is cool, definitely canüëç"
Can't login. I can't even create a new account. How are you really? It's also slow to open this application.
"Very good and useful application, I can read many books for free, thank you Ipusnas"
Is this application not ready to use? You can't login with e-mail / Facebook. The table of contents and book categories are also limited. All zones. Even though he said this was to make people interested in reading. I had to uninstall it. Sorry.
"The book is available but can't be downloaded. So unfortunately, it's strange that I've tried logging in like the beginning but it's still intact after opening the app, it's back in again by itself. Even though home WiFi is safe, opening other applications is also safe."
"The book can't be opened, even though it's been downloaded"
"Please give an Ipusnas admin solution, every time I want to enter it always looks like this ""Can't retrieve data from server and no DLS"" I've uninstalled and reinstalled up to 2√ó but still can't log in, I've downloaded several books for reference for thesis proposals at Ipusnas So, please provide a solution. Thank you in advance because the apk is very helpful."
Greetings
"Ipusnas can't be opened, why? It says ""an error occurred"""
"Bro, admin, this application can't be opened, please fix it..."
"Why can't ipusnas be opened, even though there are references that you want to find, for assignments"
"Min, why can't I open the app, bro?"
"I just downloaded why it can't be opened, it says can't connect server and DLS. please provide information"
"Pls, this apk is really good, sorry to download now"
the app is really good and very helpful :)
There are many books that don't exist yet. Intelligence or espionage is interesting reading but it doesn't exist.
"Jazahul Khoiron is a good apk That's all. But in the future, please improve it. Because this apk is good, it will allow HR to be superior through reading culture. May Allah repay the kindness. Best wishes"
Let's advance Indonesia through reading interest
Alhamdulillah. Very helpful for finding references while working on thesis
"The app is great and very helpful. A little suggestion from me, if you can make a search mode for the book so that we just write the title of the book it immediately comes out. Thank you iPusnas üôè"
"The application is good, but there is a drawback when I borrowed the book, the file can't be openedüôèüèºüôèüèº"
Many benefits
"Why do you always have to go out alone, even though the books here are very helpful"
The first error? please fix it soon @linto_aceh
Is ipusnas in error? I can't borrow books at all. And why does Ipusnas always get errors at night like this?
"Why can't it be opened? it says can't fetch data from server and no DLS, . Any solution?"
"Error. I've downloaded the book, I can't even see it"
"Hello ipusnas... I'm sorry why one of the books I borrowed didn't have any reading/writing, even though I really wanted to read the book I borrowed and wanted to know the continuation of the story. Pleaseeee.... Why huh"
Ntaps
"Now Ipusnas doesn't take long to load like it used to, meaning that the system has been repaired. Would like to give a suggestion if you can increase the collection of books on research, because the stock is always out, and when there is a notification that the book is back in stock, once you click, the book is out of stock again."
"Like errors, please fix the system."
The application is good but it's a shame it keeps getting errors. And I can't enter Ipusnas
"While the 3 stars used to be from this morning until now, it's very difficult to enter, please make it easier for the application to enter, don't log out yourself, please"
"3 stars first... Please fix the system again, bro.... My signal is fine... But why open Ipusnas instead the connection is an error"
"It's good, but unfortunately there are often errors, I just borrowed a book and after a few hours I got an error and looked for it again and it timed out. Please fix it later if it's better I'll give 5 stars üôè"
"Please fix the application system again, the content is good, but for an application of this class, how come there are still frequent errors, and must be reinstalled if an error occurs."
Very useful
Good üëçüëç
"I am happy that there is ipusnas, and I am loyal to using ipusnas. But it's been a few weeks I can't open it, so I tried to remove and reinstall it but it doesn't work, it says ""unable to retrieve data from server and no DLS"" . Sorry I don't understand what that means. Can you explain and give a solution so that I can install ipusnas again. I really need your help. Thank you very much."
"I can't open the application, I regret downloading it even though I wish I could read a book for free"
"Why can't I login yesterday, even though I really need it"
So far the app is good. Very useful for peeking at the contents of the book before buying the printed version..
"This application sucks, I wanted to read it, but I couldn't log in (it took a long time to load), so I'm lazy :("
I deducted the star. Thank you
"Very good,....."
"want to read a complicated book, where is the error again"
"Thank God there is this application, it really helps to do college assignments. Especially during this time of corona, it's hard to go directly to the library to borrow books. Luckily there is this application that can borrow ebooks online, it really helps."
Why lately I can't read the book that I have borrowed. When going to read. The application automatically closes and returns to the home page
"The application is quite helpful, already 2x or 3x when opening this application suddenly logs out by itself, the availability of the book is okay"
"It's sad to see this application, it's a really good application. But why the error often? Always says ""problem while loading book categories, unknown error""? Even though opening ig is smooth, opening FB is smooth, but it's hard to read a book, asking for forgiveness. Is it because of my cellphone signal? I don't think so, I think there are bugs in the application. Come on, please, please improve it again, so that those who have a hobby of reading will be more comfortable, it's a shame that an application as good as this often has errors. Please fix quickly."
Books are only for display In the borrowing process there are errors Even though the wifi and network are good Update laa wooi wooii
"often hangs, even though the provider has no problem. please fix the system"
The purpose of this app to get the user's media and device info?
"Suggestions for the future, maybe the reference is more completeüôè"
"Cool, but the queue is long."
This application really helps me to read many things
"Sis, I'm sorry, why can't I log in, okay?"
"Why is Ipusnas now not as good as it used to be? It used to be good to find this book, yes it came out according to the book you were looking for or not another book with the same title. Now, for example, look for retail management, and release a novel. Please fix it soon"
"The app is very helpful. Just a suggestion, increase the book collection. Thank you"
"Hello IPusnas admin, I have updated the application, but why can't I login? Please help because I want to borrow a book"
Please update it to support low specification devices. Thank you
"Is this a list option, why isn't it available? Just log in anyway"
"The application is very good and useful but I have a problem, I don't get an email for verification :'("
Very good
It's so bad
Great really helps me
"The application is completely inaccessible. Let alone to read, can't even login. I hope that applications like this can be improved. There are still many Indonesian children who like to read instead of watching soap operas, especially this application can help to increase the love of reading among millennials in the midst of high book prices."
"The apk is good, but unfortunately the book is incomplete, so we can't read all the books we want"
"This is my favorite reading app. So, when my phone had to be serviced because it was damaged and all the applications had to be reinstalled, I could no longer use iPusnas. I have contacted iPusnas via e-mail and have not received a response so far. I can indeed install. But when I want to open the app, it always says no DLS and what's more.. Please respond.."
It helps when you want to read a book
Why do I always fail to log in..? I have tried many times but still failüôè
"Thank God, this application is quite helpful. Suggestions for keywords that are typed can directly read the table of contents from a book"
"The apk is good, but why is it that when I want to log in it gets an error and also when I want to download the book but I can't even though the password is correct until I try to change the password it's still wrong please help me üôèüôè"
"Disappointed, it's been a few weeks of continuous errors, I don't have a problem with the internet signal."
Why lately Ipusnas if we have borrowed a book but after opening it on loan suddenly the book disappears? Pdhal Ipusnas is very helpful in the current online learning period
This is why the application can't be opened huh? I just installed it though. I hope you read it
This is a good application and really helpful for looking for references but why is it so often down?!!! When it's a pity
The error never ends.
"A good application with many categories of books, but there are still many bugs or errors such as exiting itself and so on."
"want to login but 'unable to fetch data from server and dls, close app?' please fix it ipusnas"
Frequent errors
"How come I can't enter the writing application, the dls server failed"
"This application is very good, it can help students to find references and the book is also quite complete. But unfortunately, errors often occur, they can't be accessed. Please fix again"
Errors often pdhl this is an important application Please upgrade the server and increase the stock of the book
Already downloaded and can't open. It says it can't access the server and there's no DLS.. I don't know what that means...
"Now it's difficult to access books, errors often occur, can't load the display even though the network is in good condition."
"Why do you like going out alone? Even though I have a lot of quota, my cellphone doesn't have an error, please fix it"
good
"It's a good application. The force close problem doesn't happen to me anymore. The collection of books is growing. Top anyway. My only suggestion, min, is to add a wishlist feature, save it first, bookmark, or whatever, which can be used to save the title of the book so that it can be borrowed later. That's all, min."
good
naps wrek
Nice app
"Ipusnas don't do maintenance often, because I rely on Ipusnas as a learning resource"
"Why lately the application is difficult to access? Even though this application is really good, it can find good reading material to add insight and information, especially in this pandemic season. It's time to increase the public's potential and interest in reading with Ipusnas. Hopefully all the features can be fixed soon."
"Why can't you borrow? In fact, the server was made in the maintenance process?? Please fix it. Moreover, I am interested in reading."
"I like it because the more Ipusnas come here, the collection of books is getting bigger and better. For the reading feature that can be shifted, maybe it can be made like the eperpusdikbud or digital grammar so that it's easy to read the book ;). Hopefully Ipusnas will have more collections and don't get errors often hehe"
"My account often goes out by itself, when I re-enter the account it doesn't connect. For the past few days I can't download the book even though the apk is the latest version. please the solution."
"there have been many improvements since my last access. but there is still something to improve. As promised, I have raised the rating. keep spirit for improvement"
Lately when I want to open the book the application always stops.
"I want to ask if, for example, the validity period has expired, can I borrow again?"
"The apk is good, suitable for me who wants to read books but don't have the money and time to go to the library. my advice 1). Provide a favorite/read later feature to mark the book to be read next. 2). Provide a snippet of the contents of the book 2-5 pages so you can know whether it is suitable or not. 3). Add a note feature because I often find interesting words/quotes but I can't SS. In the future, hopefully the collection and stock of books can be increased again. Thank you, Greetings literacy."
Thank you iPusnas for being here for us....Best Application
"Very helpful, very practical and easy to use. Continue to increase the min number of books, especially in the fields of geospatial, aeromodelling, and geology. Thank you üôè"
"sometimes like nightly errors, so far it's a good application recommended for finding books!"
Was told to verify but didn't get an email at all
The application often crashes.. please fix it
Great App
"Good application, but often errors. Hopefully it could be better"
"Recently, I often go out alone and have connection problems.. even though I'm connected to wifi.. a little disappointed.. üôè"
"The app is good, and the books are complete. However, please improve the server further, because errors often occur. I really rely on ipusnas to find book references to do my lectures :)"
Oce
"Just installed it can't be opened, is this a national reading application? I don't understand why this app can't load server data?!! Please fix, maybe if there is no response I will uninstall this application!!!"
How come this error happens so often? -_-
"Just installed but can't open it, even though I really rely on ipusnas as a learning resource"
I can't send messages. So I just give it 4 stars.
"Hello Ipusnas admin, why is it that every time I log in to Ipusnas, if you want to borrow a book, you are asked to verify your email first... even though I've verified many times, I still can't borrow books..."
"Quite a complete library. In this era of pandemic, it is quite helpful to borrow books. Implement social distancing. Thank you Ipusnas. Thank you to the team behind ipusnas. God Bless u."
"Very good application, reading is funüòÄ. Thank you ipusnas...üòô"
"Can't login, where is this cake?"
"Just last February, I gave 4 stars, how come March has an error again with the application Please fix it :((("
"I just downloaded it, when I opened the application it turned out that I couldn't log in, please fix it immediately, both the system and other devices, so that users can be more comfortable using this library application. Thank you üôè"
Only sometimes the problem is loading errors. Pls upgrade dong
Why can't you open it even though it's been downloaded many times
Very helpful for me as a student
"Good application, complete collection of books and interesting to read. But sometimes errors often occur when opening the apk such as logging out itself, every time you go out and enter again you have to log in again, and also often return to the homepage even though you want to read a book on the bookshelf, even though the signal is smooth and fine. Please fix it on existing errors and bugs. Thanks"
Useless
Excellent
Excellent
Very helpful
"Fast response, Literacy greetings"
"Hi sis, why can't the application be opened? The signal isn't bad though."
The book is so small :(
"Why does every time I want to open a book that has been downloaded, the application exits? It's been a few days like this."
"The app is good. It's just that, please add the ebook for many subjects or lectures. Because it is very useful during a pandemic like this. Thank you üôè"
Good app
"Sometimes it is difficult to open the application, even though the signal is full, it makes opening other applications smoothly but opening the Ipusnas application is difficult"
Why can't I enter? Server crashes continue.
"Can't login, notification can't retrieve data from server. Since yesterday the error continues, min"
Okay good and can be used as a reference
"Please fix the application. I can't keep going in. I have written a script there. If I can't open it, I admit that I'm confused about where to find the ingredients"
"Please fix the server, when it is needed the application even crashes, thank you"
"Hello iPusnas! I can't login, it says it can't retrieve data from the server. Please help me so I can login, thank you."
"Whatever the complaint, the answer is internet connection"
"My network is good, because the download is fast. But when logging in, it's hard, sorry, I don't want to connect, either to fb or to GMAIL. How do you want to access it try -_-"
"Hi ipusnas admin, please fix the system again, yes I want to borrow one of the books there, it doesn't work, it says you have to log in but I logged in and it said to wait for your email but it's not in my inbox"
Very helpful
"Sis, why does the app like to go out on its own when I want to read a book? info please. Thank you"
"Dear ipusnas application designer, your application is very good but your ""books are very old and not too diverse, it would be better if you add the latest ""books or upgrade them to books"" that people are looking for now 2021, lol"
"Why does every time I open a book on loan results it always appears ""unfortunately, Ipusnas has stopped"" and keeps exiting the application itself. Even though the internet is also stable, even if you change the network many times, it's still the same."
"Thank you, the apk was very helpful, but an error arrived, logged out and couldn't enter again, even though the connection and cellphone were not problematic, please fix it again"
"I really like the application thanks to this application I can read books legally, I don't read pirated books anymore :)"
"Hello Ipusnas, I am proud of this application but this time I am very disappointed because I can't log in, hopefully it will be fixed quickly"
Most maintenance. Like my own error
"Just downloaded, can't enter. If the application is still an experiment, don't launch it, donx, it's already out of quota for download, you know, it sucks!"
"It's a shame even though the apk is useful but not very comfortable to use, every time the page flickers in black and white, when I want to return the book it keeps failing, I want to change the profile and it's slow. Hopefully it can be improved."
Why can't it be installed again...
Applications that are difficult to open often lose connection with the senidir login server. Not very comfortable
Very often errors
"How come it can't be opened, it says can't retrieve data from the server, it says"
"Pls just download it but it doesn't work ;( I'm reading here, let's fix it"
"hello ipusnas! I like this application very much. but since I changed my cellphone, and I want to login to Ipusnas with a new account, why can't I? note. because it can't retrieve data from the server. then if you want to log in, when you have given your email and password, it's very difficult to log in... please help, Ipusnas admin, I want to read the story again... thank you"
"Why can't I login :( even though it's really urgent to do my homework... Please fix it immediately, I don't want to go to the library because it takes a long time to find the book :("
‚ù§
"I'm happy that the ipusnas application was made, but please why so often this app can't be used optimally? Since yesterday I want to open it always an error. Please provide good service, so that users continue to be interested in using this app, and increase reading interest. Eman2 apps are good but sometimes they can't be used optimally."
"I just downloaded why it doesn't want to be logged in, I've downloaded it several times, I'm very disappointed"
"Hello, how is this, I can't log in, the login process took a long time and now the error application can't be opened, please fix it because I want to find books for assignments"
Excellent
I can't log in Ô∏è
Cool
"Huaaa.... I really like this application, I can distribute my reading hobby and the books I really want to have but I don't have the money to buy it are here and it's all free, I just need to borrow. .But it's okay as long as it's easy and practical, it doesn't matter. I hope that many iPusnas will like and keep this apk forever. Thank you"
"I like reading books here, there are many choices. But I also have to wait if I borrow another book:"
Often comes out suddenly for some reason
"Why Yes, when I want to download a book, email verification always appears. Even though I checked the Inbox, there is no Spam email verification message. I try to download again, it always appears again."
Thank you very much the best app
"Hello iPusnas.... The iPusnas application still cannot be opened, when will the application be accessible again?"
"Sorry, Ipusnas, why can't I borrow a book even though I have registered an email, please respond Thank youüôè"
"How come it's been 3 days and there's no error, so I can't borrow"
"How is this, why can't login continue. In order for Indonesian reading interest to develop, it should not be complicated like this. Maybe there are many out there who have the intention of reading but, because it is difficult to access, people are lazy."
"Good Morning Admin Sorry, why lately the ipusnas application often comes out by itself, and the books that I have downloaded can't be opened as before (the application immediately comes out on its own) please take it seriously, okay?"
Very helpful
Thank you IPusnas. This application really helps me to read books for free. Keep the spirit in developing this application.
Disappointed that it can't be opened at all
"Very helpful, but please upgrade the system sometimes lags a lot"
"How many times have you uninstalled this apk, it doesn't work, it's just annoying. I don't want to borrow lalod, I'm really stingy"
"The application is very slow, please fix it again!!!!!"
"Hello iPusnas, why is it so difficult to access now? Hu Hu Hu. Since yesterday the application can not be opened. Please fix this problem immediately, that's the problem. If not at iPusnas, where else can I legally read books for free? I'm so sad~"
"Hellooo? Why can't I log in? Why is it always a nuisance? I swear I've been wanting to log in but it says 'failed, network time' or something. Then to log in via Facebook, why can't it? Please fix it again, because I want to read too."
"The application is good, but there are still many bugs such as the loss of books that have been borrowed, cannot load in the search and when looking for books that are displayed even other books. Hopefully in the future it will be better and can be used easily. Thank you"
"Hi! I really like this application because it makes it easier for me to read various books, but why can't I access the application now? please help. thanks."
"Thank you for the application, it is very helpful for reading but I am sad because almost every time there are errors that make it uncomfortable, and for some reason I can never activate bookmarks in translated books, the pages in translated books also feel different, this makes it uncomfortable comfortable when you want to continue reading Hopefully in the future there will be fewer errors and features in translated books can be active like books published in the country."
"Application crashes frequently,"
"Hmmm, it's really slow, just playing ML is smooth, cuaks"
worms
"Hello ipusnas, why have access often been constrained lately? So it can't be opened hm :("
"This is the habit of the server, where else do you really need it, it's even down"
Application from government but server quality is very bad :))
"Why geez. I really need the book when it comes out. It's hard to get in, I can't even find a book. I can't try to borrow again."
"For input, the application is good, but unfortunately it lacks features, the book lacks many choices for keywords, it is still limited, although there is a slight lack of evidence, I'm still loyal to reading here and now it's a shame that there are more disturbances even though there are many things that haven't been read, please hurry back to normal, pleaseüôè"
"Why can't it search for books etc? It's been a day, you know.. Server down or what? Expect a lot from this apk..üòê"
"Why is this, please fix it. Why do you want to borrow a book, why is the network timeout, so you can't read books?"
can't access
"Please fix it immediately, until now the application still can't be opened."
"Min, how come iPusnas still can't be accessed until now?"
Hello IPusnas...why now can't access the application. Please make IPusnas to immediately improve the IPusnas application to be able to help the community so that it can become a space to increase people's reading interest and help in alleviating our need to find books. Thanks in advance
"Very disappointed. The more here the application the more errors. Even though I like this application, the application feels really heavy. Please fix it, when I log in it always has a network timeout"
When will the error be over? I want to read this book
How come I can't open it even though I'm already logged in but how come I'm told to log in again?
Why can't I access books at iPusnas? I can't open and borrow the book. Please fix it admin
Why can't Ipusnas borrow books?
"MIN, LET'S FIX IT... WHY DOES EVERY LOAN FAIL CONTINUE TO LOAD THE DETAILS OF THE EMPLOYMENT BUT IT CAN'T BE BORN IN THE FIRST TYPE ?"
Why can't I borrow books from Ipusnas now? Even though it's true that the book is needed now... for assignments....
"This is why it cannot be accessed, even though there is also a connection. But still can't until a few days. Please fix it soon so it can make it easier to read the book."
"Sis, the apk is very good, sorry but why is it so hard to borrow books lately?"
"The app is good, but why can't I borrow books now? Often when I want to borrow a book, the network keeps time out"
"why can't I borrow a book when I want to borrow? I've clicked borrow, but it's not downloaded and isn't on my shelf?"
"Min, why can't it be accessed? ?? Hmm even though it really needs ..... I hope it can be improved even more, min. Because this ipusnas is very helpful. Good luck."
Hello... Why can't I login now? So automatically can not borrow books. Please fix it
"By the way, what network should the application be on? You don't want 4G, do you have to do 5G? But in Indonesia, there is no 5G network yet."
"There are a lot of good books here and I want to read them for college needs too, but I keep getting errors when I want to borrow, I use wifi but the books can't be accessed :( please fix itüôè"
"Not very mobile friendly. The application is slow, it doesn't even respond when it is opened. When it's open, it appears ""no data"""
"Frequent errors when trying to borrow books. It always says ""file not found"" :("
Invest neck up thnks
"Even though it's already good to use, it didn't take long, so it couldn't be opened at all because of the 'no dls' problem. After trying to reinstall, I can't even login :) I can only enjoy it for a while, after that I can't open it at all. A state library application like this should have a better system, hopefully it will be fixed quickly, the appearance and the system"
Why can't the ipusnas application be accessed? Please fix soon.
Is it under maintenance? So it can't be used?
"This application helped me a lot to find reference books for college assignments. But lately it is very difficult to access. Not only when logging in, but also when searching for books, downloading books, and so on. I hope this app is fixed soon, because I'm sure I'm not the only one who really needs this app. Thank you"
"Hello Ipusnas, why can't books be borrowed?"
"Please fix the ipusnas system immediately. You know, on a national scale, it's been a few days that it hasn't been completed how can Indonesia like to read? Come on, the government, this is a good application, bro, it's also fully supported. If reading is a window to the world, let's fix it as soon as possible."
"Ipusnas is a really good application. But there is one minus. Very often maintenance. In the middle of reading maintenance, looking for a book, no book information appears. Log out yourself, when you want to log in it says there is no network even though the network is really smooth. When I first opened it there was always a problem. Please fix it because I think this application is really helpful but that's how I get annoyed myself."
"Why does it appear that there is no DLS, min? When is the app back to normal, want to read it... Tks"
How come the error can't be opened
"Sis, why can't mine continue to load data, I've uninstalled it, then I download the app again and it can't even open, how are you doing? There are many books that I haven't read"
"The notification that appears ""Unable to retrieve data from the server and no DLS, close the application?"""
"Why is the apk often slow? And it often can't be opened, please improve it again and at the same time increase the number of books on the meaning of gender too, sis!!"
"Hello Ipusnas, please fix the error application immediately, I can't enter or access books. Even though I really need a reference book for research"
"Thank you ipusnas, the application is very helpful and very useful. All my college assignments Alhamdulillah helped by the books provided by Ipusnas. I have a suggestion, min, it would be nice when reading a book plus page search tools, because to make it easier, so when reading we can immediately slide on the page we want. Because if you scroll manually it's less effective hehe. Thank you"
"Hello ipusnas, how come I download ipusnas but can't open it? In fact, why does the application appear when the sentence can't pick up the server and there's no Dls, how come?"
Hello ipusnas? Why can't it be accessed?
"Hello ipusnas, why can't this application be accessed, even though you can, please fix it so that it can be accessed againüôèüôè"

"Dear ipusnas,,,,,why can't you login? if you try to login it always reads ""unknown error"""
"The application is good, but lacks features and often errors"
Ipusnas why? I can't download anything as usual. Even the app exits on its own.
"Admin will fix it right away, I can't access it, I want to do my job, hehe."
How come it can't be opened?
"Why can't the application be opened, even though there is a book that I want to restore :( how about this :("
"thank you.. thanks to the National Center for reading hobbies, I can be satisfied, but why is it so hard to enter now,, even to open the shelves, you have to log in continuously, and it keeps failing... please fix it again..."
"Hello Ipusnas, why is it so difficult to borrow books now? It always says network time out even though the internet is smooth, thank you"
"The application is good, bro, it is very helpful, but the book I want to download is always loading and an error occurs when loading the book"
"Hello. Ipusnas is having trouble, isn't it, min?"
Was this application the intention or not? Error already!
Why is this application an error?
"The application is very helpful, but why don't I go in and access it after re-downloading it"
"Please fix the application immediately, because every time I borrow a book I can't and always network timeouts and all that even though my network is stable, thank you."
It keeps failing every time you want to access. There's no problem with registration. Until I borrow a book. Please fix it
"I really like this application, but lately iPusnas is often difficult to access"
"Hello iPusnas, why can't the application be accessed?? Please provide a solution, I really need it, thank you"
"Country application, no wonder it lags a lot"
I've been using the ipusnas app for a long time but I can't access the book and it keeps getting errors
"Actually, this application is really good, but it often crashes and is slow even though I've tried opening it on a laptop too"
"Is Ipusnas currently down? I want to borrow a book, I can't continue, I log out of my own account and it says network timeout even though the current signal is still a lot of quota, please fix it immediately, thank you"
The books are good and informative. But the application has a lot of bugs now.. try to fix it again. for the sake of educating the nation's life üëç
Good upgrade
"Why after borrowing a book, when you want to open the application, it closes right away?"
"Thank you for the application so far it's pretty good, but there are some old books that I'm looking for and they don't exist and every time I change my profile picture it doesn't always load"
"Why now ipusnas often errors, please application developers to make improvements. Because this application is very useful for many people"
"Why is it that every time I click on a borrowed book, it suddenly returns to the homepage, bro? Even though it's already downloaded"
"Hi!!! Sorry I haven't opened it for a long time, when I opened it to read, the book I had borrowed did not appear on my borrowed bookshelf. How?"
"The application is good, but the features are incomplete, such as: mark a book to read later, so it's not hard to find it, difficult search keywords, for example if on youtube it's like saving to a playlist, or save it to watch later, I'll give it 5 stars if have responded"
"This application is very helpful, I hope the number of Ebooks continues to grow so that it can make it easier for all citizens to access books to remote parts of Indonesia."
The collection of books is incomplete and not much
Anyway I like this app
"Assalamu'alaikum sis, hopefully in the future the books that are borrowed can be extended, so that they are more economical in quotas. please"
Very helpful
It's very easy during this time of covid because the library in my city is closed
"The connection often drops, even though the internet is stable, please fix it again"
"Applications that are very helpful and even very perfect because this application can help me in completing. My college assignment. What else book I'm looking for is a theology and history book ehhh ..? But unfortunately, why have I verified my E-mail repeatedly but why is the book difficult to borrow? Please, hope for a reply üôè Why did this happen even though this is my last hope application in a situation like this it is very difficult to leave the house and look for books."
"Please fix it, when I want to borrow the book, the server maintenance continues, Edit: the problem has been resolved, thank you Ipusnas, the only thing left to do is complete the book collection (^_-)"
Why can't I register me in this app
"Is this book available or not = Text types in English Could it be more complete or not.. The problem is that if you buy it, it's very expensive, more than 1 million.."
"Dear ipusnas application developer, Thank you for creating applications that are very, very useful for the digital era, especially in situations like now. I (and probably represent hundreds of people who have to queue for other books) request that the number of copies be increased, perhaps 50 (hundreds are also perfectly acceptable) for the collection of course books. And please reproduce and complete the collection of course books for all types of study programs Thank you again üôè"
It's fixed...
"an application that has many benefits.. ÿßÿ±ŸÉ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá min, where to delete the borrowing queue list, right? I once borrowed a book, entered the queue list and got notifications all the time. how do you delete it? thanks"
"The application is good... It can be used for package books... Because during this pandemic, access to schools is limited, so it's rare to go to the library too... Thank you iPusnas for providing the books, hopefully in the future there will be more books."
"It is mandatory to download, especially for those who like to be lazy to go to the regional library or school library. üëçüëçüëç"
"Thank you Ipusnas, I can easily read books during this pandemic. In the future, hopefully the stock of books can be increased and the collection added."
Need to search by author's name
The system is ancient
My app keeps popping out when reading a book. Please fix
"It's very satisfying to have an application like this, the ebook is comfortable to read, it's worth it for you to download this application. But I don't know if this apk will be heavy. If it's heavy on the phone, maybe I'll reduce the star. For the dark theme, the light is still unstable. So far as a free application I am very satisfied. There are many books, but they are not complete. Hmm, maybe you can add a word highlight feature and then add notes."
"I got a recommendation from my friend, he said this apk is good, so I'm interested, and I think this application is quite good, I hope that the application can get better, any reported shortcomings can be fixed soon. Thank you for your attentionüôè"
"It's been 2 days, my pusnas can't be opened. Every time I want to enter it says ""can't read the server, and there's no DLS"" for the past 3 days, it's safe..."
Very helpful in learning........ Easy to find book references...
"I really like it, can fill my spare time by reading books. Don't get bored because the books available are also varied."
Very good application for learning and literacy. But often experience bugs/errors :(
"It's under repair, right? Because you can't borrow E-books"
Really like and very grateful for this application.
Very nice.
Quite good. But please make the book more complete. Thank you
"Hi, Ipusnas. This application is very useful, but please improve the quality of the application, yes. When I type the book title/book keywords, what comes out is even book titles that are not in harmony with the keywords. In addition, there are many other shortcomings. Hopefully it can be fixed soon."
"I want to give input for Ipusnas, please give me the registration button in the apps, please. To make it easier for users and improve the user experience"
"Min, I want to ask, why can't the borrowed book be opened?"
please improve the display when reading
Slow
"I want to say thank you very much to the manager of iPusnas, I can borrow a reference book for report writing. It's very helpful in the midst of a pandemic like this because you can't go directly to the library. The books are very high quality. If there were 10 stars I would definitely give it. My only suggestion is to increase the number of reading books or best-selling novels because I have to queue for a long time to read them. All of you students / students must download this. Thank you again iPusnas"
Excellent
Very helpful for searching ebooks
Great app! Please improve the performance of the application to make it more comfortable to read :'
"A very solid application but for application bugs that need to be fixed I want to borrow Barack Hussein Obama's book when I open it, it's just an introduction, the rest of it is greatüëçüëç"
"Thanks for this app, really useful, I can read books online. Hopefully the collection of books will be more complete. Especially in the field of engineering, knowledge, and also investment.... Hopefully the server can be kept up, if you want to go online on Sundays the server can run smoothly. Thank you"
"Please improve the synchronization between keywords and search results, because I wrote the title of the book several times but the results did not match even oot, also asked the developer to fix the application for windows (PC) because I couldn't borrow books (already entered several passwords) times but failed) and can't scroll down, even though via cellphone you can."
"Please, how do you log in, how come I can't log in because I logged in using Facebook, after that it took a long time to load, what's the advice?"
"Ipusnas is very cool, lots of good books. Must install now!!!!!"
"the song even though the book has been downloaded and can be read but why doesn't it appear on the shelf. So if you want to read, you have to look for the book to download"
"It's good, the application is steady, but the name of the application must have some drawbacks, such as 1. the borrowing time is not too long 2. the number of copies of books that can be borrowed is still not enough 3. please provide photos of the contents of the book at a glance so readers can see if the book is suitable or not."
Go forward Indonesian HR
Thank you for this apk because it is very helpful for students especially in online situations.
"Sometimes error, sometimes normal"
Awesome
"Why isn't ipusnas now accessible with talkback screen readers, talkbacks can't read books on ipusnas. Please fix. Thank you"
The search feature still can't be used even though it's been updated
Excellent
"Very easy to use and quite a lot of fun books. But in the end, why doesn't it go smoothly? Search bar can't be used even though I want to find a book :( please fix it soon"
"Can't login via Facebook or email, even though since yesterday I tried to login until now I can't. Email and Facebook accounts are correct but can't login. Very disappointing"
"Min, why is it that when I download the book, it comes out on its own, why? I've restarted and reinstalled it's still the same"
"Sis, I want it again, right, I've downloaded and installed the apk on my laptop, now I've logged in too, but when I want to borrow a book, I'm told to verify, while the verification email doesn't come in, I checked spam and it's not there :("
How come you know there are errors... DLS or something... Can't open it
"Add a text reflow feature, please, min"
Servers are not good
Wow the best
nice
"When I opened the book that had been borrowed but I moved it, the story took a long time to appear. Please fix üôèüôáüò´"
"The apk is good and very helpful. But the drawback is that the available books are incomplete when I search for the book, the book is not available (not available). And also the time for borrowing a book is very short, how can we read a book with quite a lot of pages in a very short time, maybe reading a marathon can be done, but there are many things we want to do, not just reading. I hope there will be improvements in the future.."
Very helpful
love it
it's good.... but if you can add it to your collection. greetings literacyüòâ
It's safe
"Until reinstalling, is it my cellphone or is it an error, right? It continues to fail to connect to the server, it says, no DLS."
"I give five stars because there are no more errors. Thank you, I really like this app. Please add Indonesian classic literature, developer."
"Hello Sis, previously this application was very useful, Sis, but why when I open the book it can't be detected and it seems an error, when I reinstall it it says I can't retrieve data from the server and there is no DLS, please fix it immediately, Sis"
Thank you for the information..
Why can't I open a borrowed book? When you want to read a book the application immediately stops and exits. How is this the solution?
"How long will this maintenance last? How come it happens so often, min :( Later when it's good again I'll change the rating."
keep up the maintenance bro. please follow up
"Always want to login "" an error occurred "" can't retrieve data from server"
Keep up the maintenance
"Sorry in advance, is the server under maintenance, because I wanted to borrow a book but it didn't work"
What library code?
Please fix the server quickly
"Ipusnas, please fix the server immediately, I want to borrow a book but I can't because the server is under maintenance :/"
Thank you for helping me who likes to read
Very good
There was a slight problem loading the book I borrowed. Suddenly the device stops when opening the ebook. Please help ******* It's great to be able to. Hopefully this application can develop even better
"Like this apk. For those of us who are having trouble finding book references for theses, it's made easier by this online library. Please add a book"" on biostatistics and a book"" on epidemiology, because we really need it üôè"
I like
"Ipusnas again has an error, right? The problem is that when I want to find a book, the results don't come out, there's nothing written."
Why can't it be opened
Is the application still having problems? How come when I open the server I can't find it.. anyone know why?
"Hello, Assalamualaikum, how hard is it to register?"
"How is this every time I open it: Problem loading books category, unknown error. Solution please?"
Mimin can't be opened ;( it says error
Why is this? Cant be opened. Says it can't fetch data from server and no DLS data
"Hello admin, please give a time limit for borrowing books. The problem is that there are a lot of queues, so a maximum of 2 weeks. And give a notification for those who have read to return the book."
Very good application.. you can borrow digital books and it's free
Very good
"Good, very useful, but please improve, please be notified that the book is available, so there is no need to repeatedly check the application. When I checked, it turned out that the book was out of stock again :("
the available book is incomplete
Well
"A little input for ipusnas, fix the queuing system so it's clear when you get it, give benefits to the user level, if there is no profit for what is there a newbie level to bookworm? The advantage of bookworm, for example, is to borrow books that are in line, if you are at the bookworm level, you don't need to queue. Or whatever. What is clear is that for books with a lot of queues, it is clear when you can get the queue so you don't play games, while notifications don't always appear on your cellphone. That's it, I hope you read it and think about it more seriously."
"The application is very useful, very helpful for me who wants to read a book, but wants to buy it is constrained by money. Yes, free readers are like that. Thanks to this application my reading book references are expanded. I can read cool novels here. Besides that, it also increases the interest of reading for students like me. Please improve the application again, because sometimes it likes to go out by itself, the dark mode can't be used, if you can add a notification feature. And please add to the collection"
Say hello to meü•∫üò©
Hopefully it can help me in doing my college assignments.
Very helpful for doing college assignments :)
hard to enter
Cun Badas
"The application is good and useful, but unfortunately, how come I want to comment but it keeps failing. Even though I want positive comments. That is all and thank you"
"why are you bugged? even though on the previous cellphone, it was ok. When I changed my cellphone, it said ""Can't retrieve data from the server and there is no DLS"" why is that? does anyone know and can help"
"The book is good, but I don't know how to borrow it, I've looked at google with you*ube, but I still don't understand it always reads ""server is under maintenance"", why is that, or am I wrong?"
Please improve again so that there will be no more server disturbances... a very helpful and useful apk
very helpfulüòÅ
"I'm sorry, I can't borrow a book, please, please help"
Hope it can help me
"My advice, add accessibility features so that the blind can also read books."
Why can't it be opened?
"Why can't I login, I have tried gmail, I have tried fb, I have tried the password is correct, why but I can't login."
"Min, how come I force close it? Already updated to the latest version, still the same. Does it not support the latest android? Please enlighten"
"Thank God it really helped, especially during this pandemic. But please give the preview feature first (at least until the table of contents) before borrowing. Don't want to buy a cat in a sack."
Since the update always force close open the book. Even though the cellphone ram is 4GB with 64GB memory
"Thank you, now I can use this application more comfortably."
Reading can increase our insight
How do you look for e-Resources in the apk?
It's cool that you can read free books anywhere and anytime
please increase the loan time to a week or 2 weeks
"It's good, but it's a shame that the translation of the novel hasn't been translated yet. There's no SMS, the comic collection isn't complete, like the kkpk comics don't exist. Can't screenshot & record screen(good security)"
"Very useful, the features need to be improved again"
Thank you ipusnas!
"I'm sorry, I want to ask why Ipusnas can't login via fb, you know, I just downloaded üôèüôè"
"It's a good application, but please fix the pin/page bookmark problem, it's also a hassle to have to scroll"
May it be blessed and useful Ô∏è
"A good application because it can read various books for free and legally. However, the app crashes frequently. Very annoying. Please fix it soon."
"Great app and view. Please add a ""like/favorite"" facility for books that readers are interested in but have not yet borrowed."
The application is very helpful for those who like to read diligently .... basically the best .....
Always asked for email verification even though it has been and has just been verified
"I've already created an account, but I deleted the app when I ran out of space on my cellphone, and when I installed it again, when I wanted to log in and log in, I couldn't. Please how to solve :')"
"You should make a list of books according to the author or according to the publisher so that it is easy to find books, so hopefully the application will be developed more"
Hopefully it's useful
"Useful, but it's good to be notified"
Very good
"Good, but why are the books from each author on loan so few? I often don't get the book, you know! D':"
The menus and collections are quite large and make it easier for users. It's just that it would be better if it was connected to physical book borrowing data. So a loan extension should be able to go directly through the application
How about this app? I want to login using email but the password is wrong. Even though I entered it correctly. Login via fb must be told to wait. a long time
"This app is very helpful for me in my studies, I hope there is improvement regarding this app. As often as this application suddenly cannot be run, the response is also still a bit slow when it's being opened, or doing something like loading a book when it's about to be read. I hope that when I open the application on the computer, I don't automatically log out of the cellphone application. And I hope the apk response on the computer can be improved again because it's still slow"
"How come I register with a facebook account, how come I can't even if the network is good?"
I was just about to try it but according to everyone's reviews it was good so I gave it 5 stars first
"Thank you developer, the application is back to normal üòä"
"The innovation is good and has been able to borrow more than 3 open alias now 5 open.. sorry to give 2 stars, there are some obstacles and suggestions. First, why when ipusnas by windows, when reading books. Can't you open it to read the borrowed book? Second, suggestions, if there is a wishlist. So there is a draft book that is planned to be borrowed.. Thank you min"
"The application is already very good compared to the past. There are popular books (though not all of them) such as Teras Philosophy, Sophie's World, the Fantasteen series, even the Goosebumps series, etc. Unfortunately, the book ""The Art of Being Stupidly Stupid"" isn't here yet. Please provide more popular books, especially fiction categories. For fiction is still very little interesting. Not even a Harry Potter novel yet."
"Min, my advice is to multiply ebooks from foreign authors even though the language of instruction is non-Indonesian. And also multiply the number of each ebook. Sometimes you want to borrow ebooks, supplies run out. I'm interested in an ebook about stock trading. Thank you"
üëç
"Very bad I swear. Every time I open a book, it comes out on its own. Try upgrading again"
Can't login. Even though the internet connection is stable.
"Min, the system is bugged again, can't open the borrowed book, please fix it immediately üôè"
"Actually the application is very helpful for final year students for thesis, it's just that why is it difficult for member registration, please enlighten me so I can borrow books with membersüôè"
"This application has been very useful for me, especially during this pandemic, the books that are available always manage to keep my reading interest awake. But I don't know what is the main problem with this application, lately I'm often in a bad mood with him hopefully soon improving ipusnasüíï"
"Let's read on iPusnas! The reading experience here is great. There is a bookmark feature to mark where the reading is finished. This cool. The user interface has been improved again. Please, for famous books, one more copy can be added. On my cellphone there is a dark screen problem. The e-library category can be added with famous figures, it will be more down to earth. But it really helps to be able to read anywhere. There are lots of good books. Just look in the categories you've never read. Seriously cool."
"I will give 4 stars first. Because this is my first try hehehe. My friend said this application is really good for reading original books but it's free. Later after I have tried this application, I will give 5 stars! Xixixi I hope the books are quite complete hehehe"
"It's good for reducing the reading of pirated books. And for me, who is a Mageran, I'm really happy to have this application. So you can borrow from the library without having to come to the library. The book is also quite complete. Great"
"I really like the application, I can freely read anything which is of course very useful. Embrace this pandemic. Thank you very much."
"The application likes errors, but it's really useful for those who like to read books."
"BOTTOM APPLICATION! DO YOU INTENTION TO MAKE THE APPLICATION?! I CAN'T OPEN IPUSNAS AT ALL, IT'S FREE TO MAKE THIS APPLICATION IF YOU CAN'T USE IT!!! DEMINAN ONLY OPEN THE NATIONAL LIBRARY THOUGH THE STUDENTS WORK!!!"
Keep reading
GG
Very nice
"I still have some bugs, including a book that I managed to borrow but couldn't download and the application immediately stopped. Then there is a book that I borrowed but I can't bookmark it and every time I open the book it comes back from the beginning"
Faithfully waiting even though the book is often sold out
The search feature is often problematic. Sometimes the book can't be found when it's actually there.
Why can't the book that I have saved be read please help
"Why is my apk every time I want to borrow it, why is the server under maintenance, since when do you know the period isn't finished? Edit: I've been uninstalling it for a long time because the server was under maintenance, just installed it again AND STILL THE SAME, how come there's no improvement"
"Why is it that a book that has been borrowed that was originally normal after that suddenly can't, it's gone, I don't know where it is"
Excellent
Very good
"It's good, my only suggestion is to fix the limiting feature.. because I can't use the trsbt feature and have to look for the last page I read.. PLEASE BGT YES :)"
"The application is good, there have been problems for some time. It's just that if you queue to borrow books and then you get your turn, you don't get notifications, so you lose quickly and have to queue again."
"Assalamualaikum wr.wb Alhamdulillah Ipusnas for now is good, but if you can add more stock of books in the e-library so if you want to read just read and if the queue is not too long it can take weeks... so many thanks. Wassalamualaikum wr.wb"
"Sorry, what's wrong with this server? How come you can't enter? Even though yesterday I was able to borrow books, now I can start from the beginning of logging in. Even then log out"
"I've clicked borrow. It's my turn, there's only a few minutes left on the loan, there's no data, please help, it's useless, it's been updated"
"The application is good and useful of course. It could be an alternative solution for those who want to read a book but can't buy it yet. But unfortunately the stock of books is low so the queues can be long and long, and the collection is still incomplete in my opinion. And if you can add a wishlist feature. The server is also late maybe it's having a problem? Sometimes when I want to download a book I can't, it takes too long to load, and I also suddenly logged out by myself. Hopefully it can be even better!"
"The apk is good, but it's much better if there is an apk for PC that goes through the web browser, so it's not complicated to download anymore"
Great steady
This application is very useful. There are so many good books that are hard to come by. Increase knowledge
The app is good. So far there haven't been any problems. We can look for references without having to leave the house
"The application is good Ô∏è the book collection is fun"". suitable for relaxing and relaxing to add insight"
"The application is very useful and very helpful, my advice is to extend the book borrowing period and the maintance is not long, so far so good!!"
"Why can't I login, please fix it soon, cheers. Greetings literacy."
Poor app base
The more unclear this application. Now it can't even be opened. Even though I subscribed 2 years ago. Sorry I reduced the stars
Thank you for the service. Hopefully always better.
nice
during the pandemic it's cool to also read from the ipusnas collection
There is no connection
"Edit 2: Thank you for the service :) Please improve the features, such as adding a wishlist so that the next book you want to read can be registered neatly. In order to finish reading one book or several books, the reader will have no doubts about the next book to be read :) Please increase the number of books that can be accessed. Thank you :)"
"It's really good the application helps me develop a hobby of reading and helps me in finding articles for lessons, but please fix the application sometimes like it can't be opened"
A very good effort for the progress of a civilized society. Hopefully the presence of this national literacy application is also supported by the emergence of exemplary humans so that they can ignite literacy awareness for this country.
Tengkyu ipusnas
"How is this an error, I want to borrow a book, please fix it quickly"
"Why is the server maintenance then, please fix it immediately"
"Very useful, although sometimes there are problems in borrowing books"
"Good, waiting for the next version update"
"Apk server maintenance continues, can't borrow."
Can't be used
"Hello ipusnas! Please fix the server as soon as possible ;). Yesterday I wanted to borrow a book that had a long queue, it was my turn to borrow but I couldn't because the server was under maintenance. Please fix it quickly, because I've been waiting months for one book. Thank you üôè"
"Why haven't I been able to make a loan lately, even though I've tried many times and it still doesn't work"
"There is the apk. These 2 days are not normal. Until reinstalling repeatedly. Every time I click on the book there is a notification that the server went wrong, etc. Please fix it soon. Because the apk is very useful"
"Why can't you borrow the book, bro? They say the server is under maintenance, is that right?"
"How come it's so cute, Lola"
"Every download fails, please fix it"
"There's an error again, how come the server is hard to borrow books, even though there's no problem with the data to open other applications"
Please maximize the digitization of history books and increase the collection of digital books...üôè
Ugliest library app ever
Can't borrow a time book
"The application is good, but when logging in again it's difficult"
"Developers, please fix the bugs again, because the book search is still having problems, namely the type of book category that doesn't exist because of the bug problem, thank you...."
It's good but it takes a long time to load
"The application is good, but there are still shortcomings, namely the application is very laggy, I can't see the homepage even though my wifi is working fine or not, please fix it as soon as possible so we can all read without problems"
Bug application
"Hello, Ipusnas. I can't borrow a book, it says ""Server is under maintenance.."" . Please fix it, Min. Thank you Ô∏è"
üëçüëç
Why can't it be opened and borrowed?
"I just wanted to join & borrow, how come I can't. A little disappointed."
Why is the server being under maintenance since yesterday? I can't borrow books. Even though it's necessary
"My collection cannot be extended and my latest collection is also not showing. Please fix the ""maintenance process"", some users are disturbed. Hope to be back again soon. üòä"
slow
"It's been good, but lately every time you want to borrow it, you have to do maintenance, why is that?"
"From the first time I downloaded it until now, I haven't been able to read any of the books. The notification is because the server maintenance"
"Why else?? Lately, I can't borrow and read books . Even though it's really good apk'a please explain why Min"
Very useful app
How come you can't borrow a book since yesterday?
Servers are always busy
"The application is quite good, I really like it. Old novels that I want to reread are also available here. I just get annoyed when I want to borrow a book, the phrase 'the server is under maintenance' often appears, so I have to wait again. please repair the Ipusnas. Greetings literacy!!"
Why can't I use this app? Server is always problematic
"Frequent errors, can't borrow even though I need it. Please add the collection of research methods. Queued for months, still can't get a loan"
"I like this application, it provides many books with various genres, but these few days I can't borrow books, there are always writings under maintenance, how about that? üôè"
"Why now Ipusnas can't borrow books, it just makes me disappointed, even though it used to be fine. Please fix the server pleaseüôè"
I've downloaded it but why can't it be opened? It says permission to change system settings. What does it mean? Is ipusnas really being disturbed?
Why do you want to borrow his hard book now?
"Min, I can't borrow anymore, it says the server is in the maintenance process... how long will the maintenance take, min?"
"The application is really good for those who are lazy but like to read books. But how come it's annoying now, can't borrow books"
Why is there no picture?
How come it's taking so long to load via FB that I can't open it
Is this a library...............................yes
"Very useful application. But there is a little suggestion, it is better if the book borrowing period is extended and added to the collection of books. And one thing I want to ask, why does this app not allow image capture? So you can't make story books that you read on WA. It is deeply regretted."
"The application is really good, it is very suitable for those who like to read, but I ask that the collection of books be added, especially for books today and today's writers such as fiersa Besari's books, jek (Alisjahbana Ridwan's destiny), boy Candra etc."
Very helpful..
"The app is good. Btw, please add more books from abroad too, please, min"
Cool
"After updating, it's even more uncomfortable to read, page markers can't be used, so if you want to read, you have to scroll manually to find the last page you read"
"The app is great, but I found a bug while reading a book. The bug is that it exits to the Ipusnas main page by itself even though I didn't press any buttons (only scrolling the book). This bug occurs when I'm reading, then I let my smartphone sleep and when I want to turn it on, it automatically exits to the Ipusnas main page. The Android OS version that I use is 8.1.0. Hopefully in the future the development team can fix this bug. Thanks :)"
Application is not clear
Why is it that when I want to read it comes out on its own? I can't read the book I borrowed :(
"The collection is large and very good. I understand this is a library, so stock is limited. The advantage of reading here is that you can read offline, you don't have to be online. But lately my iPusnas has gone wrong. Is that the error on my cellphone or the application? Please fix"
"a really useful applicationüëç I just want to ask this, some books read it like reading a pdf (can't set the font etc) but there are some other books that can set the background, font, and brightness too. Is that really a different book or is it my app that has an error? thank youüôè"
ok
Excellent
Ipusnas is stuck again
Many don't have books
Very nice
"quite a lot, really suitable for those who want to read more and save money. but there are still bugs like some book details that can't be opened. I want to give advice, if possible, when the book that readers are queuing up for is already available, a notification is given outside the application, because now we know the book is available / we don't have to open the application yet‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Very useful for me
"hello, it's been a long time I haven't opened Ipusnas, I tried to download it again and I want to enter my account but I can't"", why is that? I can't send an email either"
Very helpful for students
"As long as there is an ipusnus application, I am very grateful to those who made this application but I don't understand why this application is very difficult to function, every time I make a loan, it always fails and is asked for email verification even though I have done it but the request is still the same, even my email is not ipusnu replied, I ask for your help so I can get the solutionüôèüôè"
Passion for reading books broadens your horizons.
"Actually this app is really good. But what makes me angry is why I like to make errors all of a sudden, what I experience most often is when I borrow the book, but I can't download the book, even though the network on my cellphone is good and there are no problems."
"This application is honestly very good, the book collection is also quite complete. But it's a bit sad that you can't screenshot the book now, even though you used to be able to, if you can screenshot it, you can return it faster. Can you replace it with another?"
"Please multiply the book, thank you."
Why even though it was borrowed but suddenly lost the book. The account goes out on its own. Now I can't even open the app
"Why is this, why can't it be opened, it says it can't retrieve data from the server and there's no DLS?"
"Hello before, the application can be opened, why can't it now? Pls reply"
How come this can't get in :(
"This is why, how come my user application Ipusnas can't be opened, instead it looks old, then my loan book is gone too. I've restarted my phone, uninstalled it again but it still doesn't work"
Why can't it be opened...? Even though yesterday it was possible.
"Sis, how come you can't open it yesterday, you can use the same email and now you can't use the same password"
"This application is really good. Especially for book lovers, but this is just a suggestion, please add more books, but apart from that, this application is really recommended üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
"You haven't verified your email, what do you mean?"
A good breakthrough to improve people's information literacy.
"Please improve the notification feature again. If possible, add more books. I'm tired of waiting üòÇ. Thank you"
"How come this app suddenly uninstalled Tried to log in again but how come it doesn't work, it says Invalid email where it's not valid Help me!"
"The application is good, but please provide a preview or a snippet of the table of contents so that you don't go wrong in downloading the book. Because you can't see a book preview, sometimes the downloaded book doesn't turn out as expected. It also has an impact on reducing the maximum limit for borrowing a diary."
"A loop error occurred on ""library is present..."". sign out directly, and ask for permission to do it over and over again. I'll change it, when the error is resolved."
"Little errors, little bugs. Until I'm tired of dealing with it, it's more difficult than dealing with vtube members."
Can't log in
"So far I really enjoy this apk. With this apk, I can read anytime and anywhere legally, what's more, it's freeüòÑ. So, instead of buying pirated books, it's better to borrow them from this apk. My suggestion for this apk, there should be a favorite feature to mark the book that we will read next. The problem is that if you borrow it immediately before reading it, the loan validity period will soon expire before you finish reading it. Thank you"
Very good üòç‚ù§
"The book collection is very complete,,, keep increasing the number of book collections... iPusnas is coolüëç"
Very Useful Very helpful enough to find a salute book for the ipusnas application üôè thank you very much
"Hello admin, please add copies of books that are in high demand, I've been queuing for more than two months and I still can't get them. Thank you"
"Hello Ipusnas manager, please add books that have a lot of fans, please. Thank you"
"Great, jaya Jokowi and Ahok"
Thank you...very great..
"The app is lousy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!but boong the application is really good, you guys need to download it."
"This application is very good from various sides, I really like it because there is already a feature to adjust the phone light which adds comfort when reading in various light conditions, but unfortunately not all books can be adjusted in light."
I've uninstalled it but why can't I login or register an account
"Can borrow books for free,"
"I've entered my email and facebook address, but it's not a bug.. I don't like it.. it's detrimental"
"The content and quality of the book is already good, it just needs to be developed again. My correction, is it only mine, if you rotate it horizontally, you have to return to the home page. That's the only problem. please"
"Previously, for Mr. Jokowi and whoever made this application, I really thank you because this application is a form of government concern for the development of public knowledge, but here I as a new user find it very difficult to use the application and the queue system in borrowing books also makes it difficult for readers. Moreover, other borrowers do not necessarily return the borrowed book. So this application is good but what is lacking is supervision and application usage that is not maximized"
ok
"What the hell is this application, even though it's already in, I've already borrowed a book. all of a sudden the account went out asking for re-registration, when it was re-registered, even the books that had been borrowed didn't go to Bakup, even though the accounts were the same. Where is the book again important, aaaaa I'm annoyed"
Improve Reading Literacy
Excellent
"Meanwhile I give two stars.. just want to log in, it's hard to ask for forgivenessüò¢üò¢üò¢"
"Error, can't log in"
"Very helpful for final year students during a pandemic where all libraries are closed, even though not all books are available. The hope is that the book collection will be added and a word search feature will be added in the book to make it easier to find the appropriate topic in the book. Thank you"
Error. Open and close automatically
"Ipusnas is really great, thank you very much Ipusnas for providing the book I was looking for...."
Email verification then close. Bad app
"Hello, the application is good, but please, I'm queuing up for the book, I can't get it :'( sadly, hopefully in the future it will be easier to get the queue, I've waited a long time, you know, the reading hasn't been finished, the book is automatically turned over and I have to queue again huhu... I hope this apk continues to do it updating new books so that the books are many and varied... oh yeah, when do you usually update books?"
"Very nice. But why can't bookmark the page huh? If you close the application and want to continue reading, you have to sort from the beginning, you can't go directly to the last page read"
"it's been very good and very helpful, my advice for research books is to multiply because they are often borrowed, so it's difficult to read them."
why can't the application be opened? every time you want to enter suddenly exit automatically?
"What's the title, what's the cover, it's weird. If you want to find a book that passes on the main page, it's difficult, it's not even there even though the title is clearly written. It's been downloaded many times, but if you want to read the text, you still have to download it. The apk often stops suddenly. Hadehhh"
"I am quite happy with the iPusnas application, because this application is quite helpful for me in doing college assignments as an additional reference, especially during a pandemic condition like this which does not allow us to go to the library, my suggestion for this application is to add a collection of books because there are some famous books / novels that I can't find in this application, and please add the stock of books that are always in the queue, thank you."
"Assalamualaikum Have a good activity, success always ya"
Very nice
Very nice
ok min. We are waiting for the features.
"I really like it ü§ß‚ù§Ô∏è But if you can request more new books like that.. The ones from Gramedia, Novels, Comics, the new ones ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Please!! Thanks^^"
"Why can't I login, even though the email and password are correct?"
"Why is it stuck, even though I've read the book, it's still stuck, I don't want to download, please fix it again -BUILD OUR MACHINE"
"I really like this application, very useful for people who can't library. However, it's a shame lately that the error has come out on its own. Just wanted to read it suddenly came out. Even though I really need the book. So disappointed :("
Incomplete book. Looking for what book came out. Please increase the economics book
"Good this app. There are many categories of books to read, highly recommended Ô∏è"
"Min, please expand the collection. Then add a fullscreen feature, or at least don't let app notifications enter so you can focus on reading. Overall good."
"Please add the best selling translated books. Don't just book a lot of fairy tales. Science books should also be a lot. Oh, one more ebook about conspiracy."
Thanks... The application is very good
Why with the server.. can't login.. account can't open ipusnas..
"Why have I logged in but when I borrowed it didn't work, what can I do? Please fix it üôè"
Very useful for the people of Indonesia
"Alhamdulillah, really helpful"
Can't login.. From fb even email..
"Sis, sorry, how come I can't login, using the email I used before, do I need a new email? Please explain one by one so I can login"
Why do you often stop yourself when you need it?
Thank you very helpful
the book is quite complete. but why does my phone keep crashing? I've tried re-installing but it crashes every time I open the book
"Sorry, why no email has been sent to my email account. Even though I really want to borrow the book"
Why do you keep getting errors lately
"Please fix it again, I have a full signal, but the picture of the book can't be seen and there are unknown errors when I want to download the book"
"I really like this application, but why lately it often fails to add books to the collection even if the connection is smooth.."
When borrowing a book there is always an error
Why me? I want to enter the first time can't I?
Bugs
"Min, I can't use it anymore, I'm asking you to fix it üôè no dls gttu At first I borrowed a loading book and then uninstalled it, plugged it back in, it didn't work"
"Often slow when the connection is smooth, frequent errors, often force close. Yaaah..... But that's okay. The government is really clueless when it comes to dealing with things like this."
"How about Ipusnas when the application can't be opened, it sucks even though it has the government, please fix it"
The application is very good and helps improve the nation's literacy
"I just want to ask, all day trying to open Ipusnas to find books, I can't, until I have to log out and when I enter again I can't"
"How come the application is under maintenance, I want to borrow a book so I can't"
What surah is this... It's already working and can't be used anymore. Ask for re-registration then
Excellent
"Good, but there are drawbacks. My advice, please return the books on the SAME DAY, so you can borrow other books. Because sometimes I borrow the wrong book."
"Actually I really like ipussnas because it really helps me to find reference materials, but why lately has mine been out so I want to read the book that has been borrowed, I have to log in again, but before I opened it, I couldn't log in once, instead it said ""Can't retrieve data from the server and can't there is DLS, close the application? "" I see... What's the problem with this, huh? Please help, because I look for a lot of references from there for me to write. Thank you..."
"Problem loading books categories, unknown error this notification always appears and I can't borrow books like state apps, why is it like this"
"It's good, but why do you often get errors? Sometimes when I need an application error. And I give advice, in order to be able to find the desired page. Sometimes when scrolling the page, it often comes out on its own, aka an error. Thank you"
"Why when I open it, it says Cannot retrieve data from server or dls, and is told to close the application, what do you mean, even though I just downloaded it!!!?"
"I've downloaded but can't log in, please explain"
"The application doesn't work.. I've downloaded it but I can't open it.. By the way, don't download this application"
"It's a good book. But why are there often problems? For example, if you want to search for books, the search doesn't even appear. Trying to use other words and looking for it, it's still not there. Sadüò£. Huhuhu error againüò≠"
"Very good application, the book is also a lot. But it often fails to refresh the book category and its users. Please fix it soon, bro"
"Actually the application is very good, very useful, I just like to bug. Even though my internet network is good, for YouTube it's smooth. But if you want to find a book, it takes a long time to load, sometimes it fails, you have to close up many times"
"I really like the iPusnas application because after getting to know iPusnas, I am motivated to read a lot of books."
"nice app. very helpful. but maybe it would be better if you added a menu such as most read books, recently added books, etc., so that they can provide references for users who are confused about what book to read."
Why can't this application be downloaded?
"So I can't enter ""unable to retrieve data from server and no DLS"" how about this????"
The application often crashes when it wants to read and closes itself. Unattractive appearance. Bad catalog.
Beneficial
"There are not many books, maybe there can be more articles for health and medical analyst majors"
It's okay
"A very useful application, may Allah give health to the maker of the application. Kerennn"
"I hope that the number of copies that can be borrowed per book is not limited, so that I don't have to wait in line to borrow e-books"
Access to quality and valuable books has never been this close and easy
"Please, why did I join using fb for so long, I also use email and the writing hasn't been registered yet"
"This application is very helpful, especially for finding literacy books."
This application is amazing.. thank you ipusnas. So I can read books for free üôè
"Can read books for free. Very helpful. But Still need a lot of improvement because it's hard to read on Landscape view. when sliding the book down or up, the menu is always open so that it covers the writing at the top and bottom of the book, this makes reading in Landscape view disturbed. Cannot display the last page opened after closing the application. In portrait view, the text is too small & can't be zoomed because the zoom menu doesn't work. (Device : Realme C15)"
"Erm, it seems there is a bug where opening the ebook immediately crashes the app"
Very helpful
How come the app doesn't open? It says it doesn't connect to the DSL network???
"Errors keep going, very bad"
"there are still many bugs, but the efforts that have been made by the National Library of Indonesia need to be appreciated....please keep it updated regularly so that this application can be even better"
"The search feature doesn't work, so it's hard to find the book you want. please fix it soon, for the rest it's good"
A good application for those who like to read and don't have much pocket money to buy books. Hopefully with this application Indonesia will become more fond of reading and rich in literacy. Thank you for quickly fixing the bug in the app.
"Sometimes I get an error when I want to find a book, it doesn't come out. Even though the network is really good. Really love."
"hello sis. I have been an ipusnas user for a long time and this has really helped me in completing my college assignments. But why did I search for a book, it didn't show up at all, I couldn't search for a book. Please help sis üôè"
"Now it's hard to find books, yesterday you could, but not now"
"It keeps getting damaged, it's only natural because there are a lot of viruses"
"Ipusnas again has an error, right? because when I want to find a book the results don't come out, the screen is white, there is no writing. but still can open the book that appears on the homepage"
Book search is made specific and the categories are divided by year only
Like an error please improve it again
love so much
"Why, my Ipusnas, the search feature doesn't work or doesn't even work. When I searched for the book I wanted it couldn't be found. At first I thought the book wasn't available in the app. However, when I tried to find the book I had borrowed in the app, it wasn't there. Wonder me. Hmmm, please fix it for Ipusnas."
It's really bad I swear I regret downloading
"How can I do a search, but nothing comes out, then when I borrowed the book, I couldn't open it :("
"Where can I give input, questions or complaints to the ipunas admin? Q has been using Ipunas for a long time. Continuously following developments sometimes it's better but sometimes it's even worse.. Sometimes there comes an error, sometimes it fails to download but I'm just annoyed that I don't know how to contact the admin. Time to go to Playstore first to comment. Been searching for 2 days can't load but I can't find it, I've tried using any keyword but it's an error. U Upgrading may add a help column in the apk next."
"The application often has errors, loading is complete but the book you are looking for doesn't even come out, the page is still white."
"It's great to have IPUsnas, my hobby of reading is channeled, new books are also here. But these few days I can't search...why? What you're looking for doesn't show up, just blank... Even though the signal is good... please enlighten me, min.. Thank you.."
Very useful application. But why lately the search column feature has an error that can't bring up the book you're looking for? Please fix it soon üôè
both via cellphone and pc application error
"The application is good, but there are a few obstacles, why when you want to search for a book in the search column nothing appears, it's blank, right?"
"With this application, it really helps.. especially for students who really need books and have to save money. But for a few days, I am ad Kndla, no books appear when typed in the search field. Why is that?"
Why is the search bar error again? Nothing comes out when I search for the title of the book I want
"Can't be used once, can't even look for books. The list really doesn't appear. Even though I have reinstalled many times"
"The book collection is pretty good. But, when it comes to maintenance, it's better to have a reminder both before and when it happens, so you don't feel PHPted because when you look for a book, you get an empty result, you don't think it's there. The book queuing system uses a standard level system. And, I don't think the UI/UX is fresh, but that's just my opinion. üòÇ This application has great potential to increase reading interest in Indonesia, so please complete the shortcomings immediately. Thanks. :)"
"Want to ask min, is this apk being repaired? The problem is when I borrow a book or look for a book it doesn't show up"
"I can't search, an internal server error appears on Sunday, is it because it's a holiday? Please fix"
Why can't I search the title or author's name in the ipusnas application today? Is there a problem?
okay
"Why, min.. How come I do a book search but it doesn't show up??? üôèüôèüôè"
"The online library is really good, so you don't have to get tired of going to the library"
It's really good I'm a child I give 10000000000000000000 stars
"greetings admin, Ipusnas search box cannot be accessed, please help, thank you.."
Please fix it asap. I haven't been able to do my homework because I can't borrow the book. The deadline is coming soon. Please please
Best üëç
Very nice
"it's good... I often bug, you know it's out on its own. the search box facility is a bit useless, the title in the search box can't be found, but if you search for it yourself in the category you can find it."
"With this application, it makes me more happy to read, but there are still some things that need to be improved from the application. For some reason, when I use search, I type in any keywords but no book appears even though my connection is fine. It also seems that the collection is still lacking, especially many new works that don't exist yet. Hopefully Ipusnas will continue to improve and increase interest in reading for the Indonesian people."
"I used to use this apk, it worked fine.. now when I search for the book it doesn't show anything... please fix it immediatelyüôè"
"I really like this application. But please continue to improve the service, yes, frequent errors etc. Thank you. Come on please improve the performance again! This application is very helpful for learning, but often bugs."
Gift alok
"Wkwkwkwk why is it annoying.....this is a state application but again the fan is getting errors, especially when the login disappears by itself and the worst thing is that the search feature can't work even though yesterday I was happy with this application... oh my, a state application like this. Fortunately, Mr. Jokowi doesn't know yet.. if within 3 days this application has not been fixed, sorry, I will report it directly to Mr. Jokowi.."
"I've been using this app for a long time. But when I change my cellphone, I can't even log in to my old account. Even though the fb address and email are still old"
Ipusnas has a problem
"Mas, the application has an error, can't load data or whatever it says, I'll give 5 stars if the application is good, thank you"
Mine can't enter ipunas... I'll give 1 star temporarily
Added the book stock
"this application is still error, right? the problem is, why are you already logged in, want to read a book, log out again, log in again, come out again?"
Please multiply the digital book. Thank you
"I've been using it for a long time. Before the National Library of Indonesia, I regularly went to the national library and enjoyed many of its facilities. Suggestions to encourage reading for the community, so that many supporting activities are held, for example book reviews via zoom, more for ebook prizes, etc."
"I gave 3 stars first, because it's hard to log in"
Thank you for giving legal reading
Gud
5 stars is very helpful when you are late while reading
Thank you hopefully useful
"the application can not borrow anymore. Please fix the operator, please. Later when I can I will give 5 stars"
Suitable for final semester students who are looking for book references to write a thesis üôè
"Assalamu'alaikum Sis, to level up, you need to comment, so we have to comment where when we borrow books or what people post, because I've made a lot of comments but haven't gone up either. Is there a problem with the application on my cellphone?"
For the time being I'll give 3 stars first... because I'm already logged in but when I want to borrow I can't... it says I haven't entered the email... even though I've already entered the email... I've tried many times until I make it new account...but it still doesn't work...please fix it
üëçüëç
"Ipusnas admin, please, I can't open this book, every time I want to borrow a book, there must be a word sorry, your email hasn't been verified, please admin, I want to read the book, I can't start, please adminüôèüôè"
"The books are very incomplete, almost every book I'm looking for doesn't exist (economics, econometrics, sharia economics, business etc.) even though the national library :(("
"Good, but I can't find the book I'm looking for. The Madness of God & The Man Who Have Elephants : The Devil Claims God by Daud Ibn Tamam ibn Ibrahim Al-Shawni. Please update as soon as possible üôèüôè"
"I downloaded iPusnas because I wanted to register as a member of BSWClub and the 4th selection challenge had to review the short stories here. But memory doesn't continue to bless me, even though I've deleted a lot of apks... Until I finally let go of all my EXO songs. Alhamdulillah, miracle in december."
"Just downloaded, bro, first you can keep going back to ""home"" when you want to open the application again, you can't even"
I have so many problems
nice
Pls don't make mistakes
"the first time using ipusnas was fun...then there was an auto logout. when I reinstall it, I often get an error ... can't open a book that has been borrowed"
"Assalamualaikum I like this application it helps me but why is the book I'm looking for isn't there, I typed Islamic macroeconomics, why is there another book, please help, min, I need the booküôè"
"How about this, I downloaded it with high hopes, but when I opened the apk it lags. Even though my cellular data is fine, but when opening the apk, registering an account, looking for other books it takes a very long time. Even though the apk is good, there are lots of books in it. Please fix it again"
"This is the solution for people who like to go crazy when they go to bookstores! Very helpful. Have fun! . But if you can, add more copies. It's because my target book, there's a lot of queues"
Very good
Three stars because the account can't read the book please help
"Hopefully the number of books can be increased, making it easier to borrow and no need to queue"
why can't you do a book search? I'm having a hard time finding the book I want
Thank you ipusnas is very good
Thank you...The application is very good
Unable to open the application. With the description can not retrieve data from the server
Still trying new features
"I'm so happy when I know there's a new update, and when I first update I can find books. But this app is so slow. The network is smooth but every time I open there is no connection. And today it really can't be opened at all. Try changing the cellphone but can't even log in. Please help to fix it soon. And if there is a new update please don't make this app worse. Thank you....."
"Assalamualaikum for me this application is good but please add more books on history and also books on agriculture and books on food technology, and philosophy books because for me these books are more interested üôè"
"Why can't the app login using email or fb for a week and can't register, please help"
"The application is not user friendly.. very sensitive to the touch of a finger... Want to read letters too small.. when zoomed in, the reading position is easy to slide.. scrolling reading is also not smooth.. The developer should read a lot first... let me know how to make a good application"
What I'm looking for when I'm on duty
"I tried dl, registration took a long time for verification"
"This application is very good, useful to increase interest in reading. However, some bookmarks cannot be used. And sometimes suddenly the account is logged out by itself, when it's going to be logged in, it's a bit difficult. Please upgrade again :)"
"Thank you iPusnas for being here. If possible, can iPusnas add to its collection of Indonesian and world writers? Because there are many books from them that I want to read, but unfortunately there are none at iPusnas. Keep growing, thank you very much, greetings literacy."
Very helpful
I feel happy to have a complete collection
Thank you ipusnas
"The application is good, but the connection fails very often, errors when searching, or comments even though my internet network is good. Please fix again.."
"Overall, the application is good, but I warn you to be careful if ipusnas is paid. There is no sacrifice in wanting to educate Indonesia."
"Please Donk,, Every time you exit the application, when you enter again, you have to log in again, Cape Tau,,"
Force close when I open a book
Why can't I screenshot the book now?
Is the ipusnas system being repaired? Why when I've borrowed the book but the application closed itself. Thank you
I love Government
"Thank you ... a very good and useful application, hopefully the younger generation can continue to be enthusiastic about reading"
Why can't it be installed?
"How come I can't log in using the National Library's Member Number if it turns out that to borrow a book, you have to become a member first?"
"Usually it's fine, but today I used this application, after I found a book search, when I clicked it, I returned to the start page, instead I had to re-enter the email and password, why is this?"
"Please get rid of the stupid concept of ""queuing to borrow books"", it only reduces the mobility of readers. We want to be able to read e-books anytime and anywhere. We are already in the 21st century."
"Every time I want to read a book, I immediately exit the application, please fix it"
"The national application period is like this, I hope it will be better in the future"
"The application is good, it can be used to add references to paper assignments, butiii. How come the list is so hard, because ""there was an error yesterday"" so I uninstalled it and then reinstalled it when I registered, it's really hard to want to cry, I've registered many times but I can't"" . Please help, I have a lot of work to do"
Very nice
Well
"It's been fixed. The application is pretty good. Although not all the books I was looking for were there, they were good overall. I enjoy it because the collection of classic translation books is quite large. Hopefully in the future this application can be even better."
Sometimes it's an error
"I want to be angry, I installed this app for days but I can't use it, I can't login, I can never log in, and some other apps are the same, so what's the meaning of this online library if it's just php, I swear"
This application really helps me to be able to continue reading books without having to buy them
"Not much of a list of his book collections. I looked for books on BIPA too, there were none. It's really sad, even though this application should be very easy for users who need books without having to come to the National Library directly, which will save time and money. Please complete the collection again, students really need an application like this. Thank you"
"I am disappointed with ipusnas, every time i read a book that has been borrowed it always comes out by itself and a notification 'ipusnas has stopped'"
‚ù§
"Ipunas is very good. But admin, please fix it again. We want to borrow a book, but we haven't been able to since we asked for an email. We really need books here. For reference purposes of our paper. Please fix it soon, admin"
"I like this apk. But please add the features please. For example, the feature of extending the validity period of the book. And the notification, please send it directly to your Android, so you know when the stock of books is there. Edit: Please include the latest novels, for example: Matahari Tere liye, Ciderela batavia. And please make a category for example: adventure novel category: Novel A, Novel B. Textbook category: Book A, Book B. Please update again, I hope my review helps"
thank you the books on ipusnas really helped me in finding references.
"The application now keeps getting errors, when you want to borrow a book, you can't do it"
"Hi admin, why can't I borrow a book, bro? Even though I haven't borrowed a book today and my library is also empty, btw this happened from December 12th. Please solve."
"It's good, it's just that there are less novels, more rules are added for novels so that the reading interest of the lay people can increase"
Why does the error keep going...??
"Mas developer, please, why is this an error, can't it be opened? Even though it's been updated. üôè"
"It's hard to register, it also often makes errors"
"Sorry, why does it keep getting errors?"
Frequent errors and I can't open the book.. Sometimes I can't borrow.. After borrowing it looks weird.. Can't bookmark.
Why do you get errors so often? It's UAS season again. It takes a lot of reading. How can you not read pirated books if legal applications often get errors like this
"admin night! I want to complain about the app being ugly. Often hangs alone. Even though my network is very stable and fine. It's often very buggy, even though it's time for Ipusnas to really need it. So please fix it right away, bro, I'm the only one I rely on ipusnas"
Why are there so many errors lately? Even though I want to find books for college assignments :(
"Why when I want to borrow the writing, it keeps getting network errors even though the signal is good."
"It's really good, but there are so many errors"
"The books are many, good and varied. But I'm often annoyed because it often crashes suddenly, so the application gets annoyed because I can't read or borrow. Hopefully it can be fixed, so it's easier if you want to borrow or read a book."
"Ipusnas has a problem with the system or what?? How come every time I search there is no connection, even though my network is good"
"Min, please update and fix bugs again, the application cannot be opened because there is an error loading DLS."
"Why does the error keep going, I have reinstalled it, but it still can't be opened huhuhu. Come on, fix it again"
Most useful app on play store
"Error, even though I want to read a book, hopefully it will be fixed in the future"
"This is actually really good and very useful. But why can't the error enter? Even though it was smooth at first. Until I redownload but still error. Why huh??:"""
I can't open the app and many of the books I'm looking for don't exist
"This application is good, why can't it be opened now?"
"I like this application, it is very helpful in finding references for college assignments and thesis. But why do you sometimes get the error ""problem loading book or network error"", even though the signal is also stable :( besides that sometimes it's difficult to log in so you have to delete and reinstall it first. Please fix it again in the future. Thank you."
"Thank you, this application helps me in finding assignment references. Yesterday I downloaded this application and was able to borrow books üëç but why today when I click on the book I want to borrow and can't. Then when I ""clear data"" this application won't even open? I've been like this many times, how come I have to keep installing and uninstalling? Please fix again üôè"
ok
Very good
"Cool IPusnas! However, please fix the error when logging in. I hope iPusnas continues to grow to be better."
Lately the error keeps. Can't borrow books. Is there a disturbance?
"Please fix it again, even though I already borrowed the book, I downloaded the book too. But when I want to read the book, the screen is all white, there is no writing :( In the future, please fix it again Edit : Even now it can't be opened, it says there is no DLS. How is that?"
"It's hard to log in, even though I really need it. I have seen since last month many of the same problems as me. Hope it gets resolved soon"
"Can't enter the application, the error continues. Even though the application is good, it's a shame it can't be used"
"Why do I always need this error when I want to go to trial My book has an error again, it sucks"
"Finally, after struggling to log in, you can"
"Why do you keep getting errors? In the midst of a pandemic, the need for brain nutrition also increases as the release of pentvga can be everywhere. Please fix Ipusna's management. After all, if you get a budget from the state budget, the system needs to be fixed."
"Why does it say ""Unable to retrieve data from server and no DLS"". Why me?"
Why did Ipusnas get an error for borrowing a book? usually it's fine. Even though I still need to do UAS Help god
"The application is good, the book is quite complete, unfortunately it is easy to error."
is not opening...
Why can't it be used??? The description can't retrieve data from the server??? How's this....
I like books on ipusnas but why is there an error? I've deleted the data and reinstalled it even more errors that initially I couldn't borrow books so I couldn't enter the application at all.
Why does the application keep crashing? Even though I really like this application. There are so many books that it feels like I have my own library
"The error was that I couldn't log in, anyway, now Ipusnas is bad"
"the error occurs again, I will add a star if you can read it again on ipusnas"
"There are quite a lot of books, and books that have been borrowed can also be read offline, I suggest adding features such as wishlists, or reading lists later. It's a good application."
Errors keep on min !!! Ô∏è
"Actually this application is good because there are many books to choose from and it is suitable for those who like to read, it's just that it always has errors and is still slow so it's a bit uncomfortable. Hopefully in the future it will be improved and better so that it is hoped that it can increase the reading interest of Indonesians."
How come I can't enter?
"Very often errors, can't login, and fail to load categories. I'm sure Indonesia has lots of great developers who can fix the problems this app is having. I hope that Ipusnas is really well maintained, so that it can be used as a source of quality reading references."
"If I make an application that I intend to uninstall, I still download it, but I still can't get an error, but I can't just borrow a book. You can't want to finish my quota or what have I been angry with the teacher for 2 weeks because of the reason I got an error until now the teacher doesn't believe it, you idiot"
The application is slow response
It's been almost a month the error & can't be opened...üò¢üò¢üò¢
The app is good but the error keeps :(
"Looks like this apk system has to be up again so it doesn't get troubled anymore. Maybe the problem is that if there are many users, the system isn't strong enough. The point is I support this apk and it is very useful. Thank you"
"The application is very good, I am very grateful to the national library for making this application. For suggestions to increase the collection of books that can be borrowed, especially encyclopedias and books on theory and philosophy as well as overcoming some bugs in this application. That is all and thank you."
"Borrowed books can't be opened, when clicked they close the application even though they usually don't, is it really an error?"
Yesterday there was a problem when logging in but now it's running smoothly as usual. Thank you to iPusnas because this app is very useful for finding various information.
"The application is bad, often errors. Now I can't download the book."
"is there anything wrong? I can't borrow a book, I can't search for a book. How is it."
Why when I download the book it fails trs. With a notification about the apk server appearing. Please fix it soon! thanks.
"hello admin, i like this app, i've also found some books that i've been eyeing for a long time but there are also some books that i can't find in this app this app is good, the book borrowing period is ok, maybe you can add 1 / 2 days ? awww, what I don't like is that the queue book availability notification doesn't appear in the notification bar + you have to open this app first, that's what makes me sad every time I'm late for a loan fight, that's all admin from me, thank you admin."
Thank God I can read books comfortably again. Looking for references to write papers too Ô∏è
"I'm a new member, this app looks good, it's just that the queue for popular books is really long üòÇ. I got the serial number 3000's. I hope that the book collection will continue to be updated and added, especially for reading novels and popular translated books. I as a student who is in the very busy category, have started to leave reading activities because I don't have time to go back and forth to the library, thank you to the relevant parties for procuring this application üôèü•∫ #terharu"
"Sorry, every time I want to borrow a book, it always says the server is in the process of being repaired. Approximately how long"
"I'm glad that this application exists, so I can read free books and reduce people to buy repro books. But please don't make frequent errors in the application, please :( Especially if it's at midnight above 12 pm the error is very frequent, even though at that time many people stay up late and want to read books. Please fix it again, thank you."
"You, I want to enter the application, it's difficult"
"Why does it suddenly keep getting errors? . Even though I really like iPusnas. Hopefully in the future it will be even better, I really support this one. Edit: Alhamdulillah, now it's good :) In the future, hopefully there will be more useful novels for entertainment during the pandemic. Thanks iPusnas!"
"Even though the apk is good, but how come I updated it, I uninstalled it, then I installed it again, it still can't be opened. How are you, how come I'm confused min.. :("

"Previously this application was easy to access but when it was reinstalled why was it difficult to access, min? It's hard to open even though my internet is in good condition."
"Sis application error. I've cleared the cache, still can't open it."
"The application is very helpful for new students like me, but my advice, please don't make errors too often :( When you refresh it, the problem keeps loading :( I hope the system will get better with this comment :)"
"Is there a maximum condition for borrowing books? Because lately how come books can't be borrowed anymore, I give 5 stars, and please fix it"

It's good but now why is it getting errors please fix it

Why is it so hard to access now? Even though the application has been updated and the signal is good
"For the application, why can't it be accessed? Please fix it soon"
"The apk is better, but at certain times the apk crashes which makes all the data in the application disappear so you have to start logging in again, please fix it :)"
"Assalamualaikum hiiii I'm queen, I like this apk, it helps me study and read more, but there are problems when I lose, I enter, there's a notification that I can't connect to the server, if I may know why?"
The ipusnas application is very useful. But why can't I open the app now? I've downloaded it but it always says can't retrieve data and no DLS
"Sorry, I'm a new user. Why do I always get an error even though my data signal is good"
"The application can't be opened, please fix it again"
"even though it's a good application, where else do you really need it but why do you suddenly get an error huh?? the book can't be opened, then I delete the download again the application can't even enter, how can you fix it, thank you"

"Lately, it's getting more and more errors, isn't it... Even though this is my favorite application. And from other reviews, quite a lot of people experience the same problem. Please fix it immediately so that this application is as comfortable to access as it used to be."
"There are still many features to be added, such as a feature to mark the reading limit or others. Until now, how come there is no feature for the reading limit, even though it is very important."
"Just goods, ok."
"The application is good, the storage can also be called small, the books are also a lot, but I don't think it's complete. There are many novels that don't exist, for example by Tere Liye, only a few of which are available on Ipusnas. Come on, please add a collection of novels so that the interest in reading for the nation's children will increase. Our country is at the bottom you know in terms of literacy and reading. The spirit of Ipusnas to add the book"
Thank you for presenting a very helpful app
Why can't we open the books we borrow and always exit the application?
"Why. When I want to open the ipusnas apk, an error occurs and again why did I login before it failed . Sorry 1 star"
"Thank God Ipusnas is able to search, but why is loading difficult to enter?üò¢"
"Good this app. Read books so much better, it's free too. His collection of books is now even more numerous and varied. Well, although there are still some drawbacks. Keep growing iPusnas!"
"Good reading application...but why every time I access it always ""an error occurred unable to retrieve data from server and no DLS"". Please fix immediately. Thank you"
Why does Ipusnas often have problems? Even though this application is very helpful in terms of scientific research during the pandemic. Please fix it soon
The application is good in terms of convenience. It's just that it still crashes frequently. Sometimes it's buggy and blank even though the signal is fine. Please improve again.
"The application is very helpful, but lately it can no longer be opened even though the internet connection is smooth, please fix it soon"
"Give 3 stars first.. because it loads when you enter, just wait.. even though waiting is not good also the network is good and I've tried hotspot to friends.. ehh still waiting ae"

Why when I borrow an error book I can't borrow
good
the book is more complete
Why can't my Ipusnas log in?
"Admin, why do I suddenly have to login again :("
"Then it can be rotated to read it, even though it exits the application itself. Now it can't even be rotated using infinix hot 8"
"The quality of the appearance and performance of the application is inferior to the others, even though it belongs to the state"
"It's been updated, but why is there still an error?"
"At first it was smooth, then it was bad"
"Why is this after downloading it can't be opened? The description has an error, unable to retrieve data"
"To Ipusnas, I would like to thank you in advance for the response to improving the search feature in the application. However, I would like to convey that the application still has problems, namely when searching for books. The book you are looking for can appear but when you click it, the book view does not appear and the book cannot be borrowed. After crosschecking, it turns out that the problem is in the application, not my cellular network. So please fix it soon üôè"
"Why can't it be opened every time, even though it's still important"
"Sorry, I gave 2 stars, why did it suddenly stop by itself. If you want to borrow a book, you often fall"
"The more you come here, the more frequent the errors. Starting from the search feature, I want to borrow the book but I can't access it. Please fix it soon min"
"It's really hard to log in, it's been a long time coming in"
"How come when I want to borrow a book, there must be a message, there is no email verification, then what is the way to solve it?"
I am a teacher and this application is very good for insight into my thinking at every step in my life
"Min, the server is down? Because you can't borrow books."
Please fix it. Ipusnas often makes errors. It's very disturbing... This nation has a lot of stock of young people who are good in the IT field... If you feel you can't find a new IT team that is better üôè
"I really like it.. It helps to improve literacy, and free time becomes useful. But yesterday the application on my cellphone had problems until now (cannot be opened).. What should I do? I want to read the book again :("
"How come mine can't be opened, the notice can't retrieve data from the server and there's no DLS"

Application cannot be opened
"It's good, it's just that there are always bugs."
Increase the number of reference books for students
Why is it that every time I want to borrow a book I can't?
"Don't like the 1 x 24 hour return system. Because sometimes it is borrowed first to see if the contents are good or not. If you want to borrow something else, you can't because you have reached the maximum borrowing limit"
"At first I really enjoyed this app. Very helpful but lately there are always problems as many other users have mentioned. Hopefully the error can be fixed soon. Thank you for the application, I still give 5 stars."
"Why does the National Library class, which is funded by the state, often make errors? Tired for a long time"
"Can't be accessed and can't retrieve DNS server :( , please fix again"
"Search feature please fix! Yes, every time there is a problem in the search column, this is a state-owned digital library, the quality is good. Greetings literacy"
"Why can't it be opened now? And until when? It's a shame, because Ipusnas is a substitute reference for the current library, even now it can't be opened."
"Sis, I've already downloaded the application, but how come I can't open it? In the notification it says there is no DLS.."
"needed when important but not useful. Stop stop. Haven't used it yet, it's stopped. How do you want to try it?"
Why can't it be opened? Even though I really need it for work. Hmm...
"When you first open it on Android, a message appears, no dls data cannot be retrieved, why is that?"
This is why every time I open the application there is always an error' ... is there any maintenance? The problem is that it is very annoying for about 2 weeks and always like this. I even uninstalled then downloaded but it's still like that
"Sorry to give 2 stars first. Because there are many obstacles. Hello, it's my first time to install iPusnas, I started looking for books smoothly. But when I want to look for another book, how come it appears ""no data/reload"" and I've refreshed it, it's still the same. I've tried clicking on all the different categories of books, but the same thing appears. I thought it was my data network that had a problem, it turned out that after I try to open the apk. Everything else is fine. Please help. Thank you."
"Suddenly out of account. Can't login again. The search for loading takes too long, you have to reload."
Why can't I login to the app again?
"It still often fails to connect to the network:) please fix it, why is there an error?"
"The application is good, but why is it that now every time I want to search for a book, the search doesn't show up, it's been updated and it's still like that. Then I tried to logout, but when I tried to log in again, I couldn't. Please fix it, the application is very helpful though"
"Why can't borrow/read books, can't find books too? Please give a solution"
"what's wrong with Ipusnas, how come it's not like it used to be. Even though at first you can search for any book, borrowing is also good. how come it's changed now? it's if you change this cake. How can we be smart, while we, if we are rich, will buy books at bookstores and maybe borrow them from Ipusnas. please understand. # of the little people want to be smart."
"How come I can't open it now, bro :("

"A few days ago I couldn't find the book, now I can search but I can't read it. In times like this, why does the application get an error?"
Hadeehhhhh.... Very dissatisfied using this application.
"I gave 3 stars first.. the problem is that it's fun to read, the pages are all white, the contents of the book are missing.. that's why huh.. I waited for a long time, nothing was written, I saw another book, there was writing, cm that It's fun to read, if the writing is missing.. hopefully it can be fixed soon.. yes, min.."
"Thank you for accompanying me, please fix the bugs and multiply the books."
Likes to go out alone... Troubled
"Why is it that when I log in from either my fb account or email I can't log in, ""please wait"" for a long time, and in the end I can't. Even though I used to be satisfied reading Ipusnas books, now I don't know why I can't. Admin, why is this?"
"Please fix the search feature, it's not working since yesterday"
"I really like the apk, especially for reading novels. But there are some problems, such as the search feature, sometimes errors also come out ""like that. And the loan time limit which may be a little while. That's all, I like the rest. It's being developed again, thank you"
"Why do I borrow a book? he said, please verify the email even though I have verified"

"Thank you for helping a lot, it's smooth ""continue min"
I just want to try this application.. hopefully it will help me to increase my knowledge
"Suggestion yes. The function of returning books should not have to be 1 x 24 hours. Sometimes the books you borrow don't live up to expectations. If you can return it immediately, the quota can be used directly to borrow another book."
"The application is good, there are many books that I can read for my assignment"
"I used to really like this apk. But getting here, why can't I open the book, why? Error continues. Even though the network is stable and okay, the connection is also good, the memory is still a lot, the cellphone specs are also good. Please pay attention"

"When will the search be fixed, it takes a long time, I beg the ISpusnas to fix it immediately"

"Disappointed lately that I can't search, even though I really need it"
"Why can't I search for books even though my internet connection is good? Last week I was still able to find books, please fix it immediately I want to find books for thesis materials"
Why can't I do a book search? Even though before it could
"Why can't I find a book in the search column.... Even though the words entered are correct, and clearly the book I'm looking for is in Ipusnas,"
The search doesn't work
"The book collection has been expanded again, yes, and there is a problem with the search site"
I'm having trouble in the search section
"I'm confused why when I search in the search bar the book doesn't appear, right? Explanation please?"
"Ipusnas is now ugly. All the books you are looking for don't exist, every time you do a search it always doesn't show results.."
"Actually, this is really good for reading, it's quite complete, but sometimes there are errors in dls, just blank, there's no writing, it's confusing if you read it blank"

"The book is incomplete, besides that until now I can't search the book, it says 'result not found', please fix it"
Useless. The category you are looking for is always not there
"Previously this application was fine, but why has it been getting an error lately in the search menu."
"Why does the application often error when I really need it to find references for writing assignments. In the past few days the search feature has not been able to be used, it always appears ""Oops search not found"" Even though the application has just been upgraded but well, something like that has an error. Hopefully it will be better in the future."
Is it still under repair? I tried the search feature and still can't until now. Please confirm. Thank you
"how come it can't be opened, when you want to borrow it, it says enter the password for registration, what do you mean, bro? please, I want to read the question"
I've been doing a book search for the past few days. But always does not display the book you are looking for. This is why even though before it was okay. It's a shame that this application is really good. And help. Please fix it soon.
"This is an error, the search doesn't work"
"Please fix it again. We really need a lot of reference books in the near future, especially since we have entered UAS assignments. Previously, the search menu was fine, but now it doesn't display the book you are looking for."
Dluh.... why does the error keep going...
"This is why I got an error, I searched for Indonesia when it wasn't there, I couldn't find it, it said , I'm annoyed, where else do I need uhhhhh"
"Now there are more and more errors, yes, it's really hard to borrow books while looking for errors"
It's good
"Why can't the search feature be used now, every time you enter the title of the book you are looking for, the results are always empty. Then I tried to enter the title of the book that appeared on the front page of the application to test the search feature, it turned out that the search results were also empty, even though the title of the book was clearly on the front page of this application. Please fix it so that the search feature can work again"
"Applications that are interesting and add knowledge, Insights. Hopefully ipusnas will be useful for everyone"
"Thanks in advance, this application makes it easier for me to find references. Since yesterday I tried to do a book search the results are always not showing up. How's that huh?"
"Why ipusnas error'? I did a search and I couldn't find it, I thought it was my cellphone that had an error until I borrowed my parents' cellphone and it was downloaded but it was also an error. Please, sir / Mrs. Ipusnas and Wapernas are repaired, it's very important during this pandemic, please fix it"
"Before it was good, but lately it's an error I can't find the book"
Suddenly can't find the book. Please fix again
"I used to read using this application, I still like it, why am I using this application just to find the author's name, how come it doesn't work, why? Please help"
Search could not find any book !!! Please correct
"Since the 25/11/2020 until today on the 27/11/2020, how come the search doesn't work, right? I'm sad.."
"My search section often gets errors..pdhl usually doesn't..the book I'm looking for is actually there but why is it written oops...please fix it, min. So far I really like this apk. good"" and thank God it managed to fill my free time and has been faithful to accompany me for these 4 months."
Why can't I find a book?
"What is this sister, I'm confused why when I want to borrow I can't continue!"
I really like this app
"An application that I really recommend for you book readers, because here there are so many cool books that you must read."
Error then. The search results won't come out. Please fix it soon. I need a reference for assignmentsüò≠ (27/11/20)
"Please fix it, the search menu can't be used, it doesn't work"
"At first I was able to search for books, after a while how come it doesn't work, I always fail when I search"
"The apk is actually really good, but how come you can't find any books now?? Can't you find any more books here or what? Books that were borrowed and downloaded are no longer there, lost somewhere . I've tried reinstalling but it still doesn't work Please provide a solution, I really need it"
"It's really annoying, how come the search feature doesn't work, right? How come every time I search for a book it doesn't come up? Even though 3 days ago it was still possible. Please fix it soon, thank you."
Good morning. It's been 2 days I can't use the search mode either by title or by author's name. Is this a problem on my cellphone or the application? Info please. Thank you
The search feature cannot be used. I wonder why? Even though I want to read a certain book.
Is there a bug in the book search?
"Lately I can't access the book I'm looking for, it always appears blank. Please help me."
"I really like this application, it is very helpful in finding the books you need. But why now I can't search for books, at the beginning I downloaded, I can find the book I want, but now, every time I search, none of the books appear, the display is always empty, I've refreshed many times, it still doesn't appear. repair it üôèüôèüôè"
Why am I every time I search the title keyword I never get a row of book titles
"Searching in Ipusnas is problematic, can't find books. 3 days ago it's fine, I've tried uninstalling and then reinstalling the app but still can't search for books."
"When you first enter, how come you can't, you can't recognize the server"
Errors occur frequently. I want to return the book it always fails
"Sorry for the moment I give 3 stars first. I've updated, uninstalled and reinstalled. Every time I look for a book, not a single book comes out even though I have tried many times but there is not a single book. Thank you, please fix."
"Sis, sorry to ask, how come the search feature can't be used, right? It says ""error"" how do you do it?"
"How come Ipusnas turned out like this, I went to Ipusnas and asked me to reload it after I reloaded the error and I tried again the error was again, then I tried to borrow a book but it couldn't be borrowed even though I clicked on borrow but I couldn't, then I tried to find a book about it The library methodology in the search column doesn't even show up, so I tried to find another book again and it doesn't appear, it's really weird... Even though Ipusnas used to be good but now it's weird like it can't be used..."
"Why has the ipusnasku application kept getting errors for 3 days. Can't open, or can't view books. Even though I was really happy because there were so many new books. Please fix it soon. Thank you"
Why has the search system been crashing lately?
Why can't the search field show the book?
"The application is good,,, It's just that there have been a lot of errors in the past few days and can't use search mode,,, Please fix it soon üôè"
"3 stars because there is a problem with the search feature. The search results are always confusing, even though I've uninstalled it and then installed it again, everything is still like that. Please correct that's why"
"Today I tried many times to search for books, but there are no results in the search field. I've also tried to find a book that I've borrowed, but the result is the same, I can't find any books. Why is this possible? Even though I want to do a college assignment. I hope iPusnas recovers soon. Amen!"
"Why is the ""search"" not working??"
"very good. but why do you often get errors, sometimes you like to say internet problems appear, even though the network is just fine. I hope it's fixed"
"How come I'm looking for the book I want in the search, how come the pictures are all white? why is that"
"The application is not clear, can't be opened.... Why is the innovation like this"
"The application is very helpful for finding ebooks, I have a little problem, when I return the book there is an invalid item description, why is that? Thank you"
"Why is it that the book that I borrowed after the loan time expired, I was looking for it again wasn't there even though it was really important"
"Sorry, why lately Ipusnas often has problems even though the signal is good, then the searching button always doesn't work. Thank you"
"It's good, but how come after the update it keeps getting unknown errors. Can't be opened again. Confused what went wrong. Also looking for it can't be found, so why is that? Is the apk error or what. Now I can't open it anymore"
Ipusnas is a good application for readers. Handling of reader complaints is quite fast. Hopefully in the future this application can present an increasingly varied collection. Thanks ipusnas..
"I like the application, only for a few days I can't find the book, it's always loading and then I come back, I uninstall it, I install it again, I can't even enter it at all,"
Why can't I enter the application? Info please
Continue to develop the application. Hope it will be better.
"Often I can't even search, whether the server is busy or the application is stupid... my emotions"
How come I can't search books?
"Erm, my apk often has errors, I like to often trouble data. I don't know what that means?? Please help.."
Hello.. why can't I use the search feature?
"I want to read Rick Riordan's book.. I'm still reading 2 books. I just wanted to read the sequel, suddenly I can't search."
Now difficult to access
"When it's important, this is how the application is, if you really want to update, then update, so it's hard to use this application again"
the application is very helpful.. even though you have to be patient waiting for the book in line.. hihihihu
"Previously it was fine but why lately there are frequent errors? November 26, 2020. I still have problems in the search section. Searches always show no results even though the application has been updated to the latest version. How long has the error been?"
"Applications often crash, especially when using the book search feature."
For older versions
Quite a complete collection of books. It would be better to add a collection of newly published books.
"First, the rating is three. The problem is when the application is suddenly asked to log in? Have you logged in and reset your password on the website, but the application still says ""Password doesn't match"" why? Please help..."
Bad applications do not download.
"There are often errors when opening or borrowing books. The books are still incomplete, please update again to be more complete"
I just downloaded the ipusnas apk but when i open it it says Cannot retrieve data from server and no dls. That's why
Like bugs and errors
Sometimes the search results do not match the keywords
"How come this can't be opened, bro but it's really good"
"Why does an error occur when I open it, even though the network is very good."
"Can't log in, it says it can't retrieve data. Even before you can uninstall it. Why is this?"
How long will the disturbance not be able to borrow this book?
"It was good at first, but when it's been opened 2-3 times, it's an error, the application can't be opened again."
"Now, when opened, ipusnas always experiences problems such as unavailable data and so on. What a pityüíî"
Time out trs even though the connection is smooth. Can't load the book
I've been using iPusnas for several years and so far it's been running smoothly. But lately it always fails if you give a book review after you finish reading a borrowed book. Hopefully in the future the application can be updated so that it doesn't have errors and troubles. Thanks
"I've noticed that there are more and more books on Ipusnas, I'm really happy btw, try adding the ""read later"" feature, please. Then, maybe not, in the future Ipusnas will make paid/subscribed features like that? This feature allows users to borrow books without queuing, or as a way for readers to contribute to (pay) the author. Hehehe"
The point is error.
Very helpful in increasing the knowledge of the Indonesian people..
"The application is really good, especially during this pandemic the library is still closed. With this application, you can keep reading books anywhere and anytime. But it would be better if the last page we read was saved automatically, no need to bookmark. So when you want to read it again, it's already on the last page that we read"
"annj1nk application. Fuck asking permission to set up the system, and look at the folder. Kammp4nk!!!!"
"how come the app can't be opened after a day of using it, what country app is it?"
Most errors
Why is the app a setback... the error keeps on borrowing books
"Suggestion, also add fiction books, even the little ones want to read books even in the middle of a pandemic"
"In the search field is not accurate. The title of the search book is the same as the result, even a children's story. Not accurate. Please check again"
"I think this apk is interesting and good, the system is we download the book first and then read it offline, please multiply the book and make it simpler in terms of overall. And one more thing, please add a lighting system, I read it for a long time so it hurt my eyes. Regarding followers and being followed, please make it interesting so that users can follow it but get the benefits. In the search menu, sometimes it is difficult to find the book you are looking for."
"I like reading in this application, it's not complicated.. but how come the ""search"" doesn't work huh? I hope it can be fixed soon. Thanks"
"Sorry, why does the application often go in and out by itself, even though I have repeatedly reported it. Even though I want to borrow and read books for assignments. Please fix it soon üôè"
"Cannot open ""Unable to retrieve data from server"", later when there are no problems I will add a star"
"The application is really good, but why can't I borrow books at the end of the day... It's like an error in identifying the details of the book... Huhuhu.. I'm still working on my thesis. errorüò≠"
"In the last few days there have been problems loading category data. Unknown Error. Even though the cellphone signal is good. Please fix this unclear error. This application is really good, please fix the error"
"Can't take screenshots, the rules are too excessive besides the number of books borrowed and the number of books that can be borrowed is limited"
"Why can't it be opened? I've reinstalled it, but there's no server and DLS available??"
"Ipusnas keeps getting errors, hire a reliable and dynamic developer for this application, I'm still wondering how you want to help educate the nation"
Please fix again I tried to login can't login
"every time I want to open iPusnas there will always be an error, why is that? does iPusnas still have an error?"
"the past few months there have been frequent errors, the account is also sometimes not detected"
"Sis, how come it's hard to borrow books lately, the error continues I want to work on my thesis, when do you think it can be accessed again?"
Why can't I login? Even though I still need a reference for research
"I downloaded the apk but can't open the apk. It always says there is a problem cannot retrieve data from the server and there is no DLS, close the application?. Why can't it open??? Even though I really need it"
i can't access to the app because there is no DLS :( how is this?
"Can't be opened. It keeps failing, please fix the application again."
"The error time out continues. What happened? Fix it soon, please.. This is a literacy solution in times like this."
"Please update the application again because there are still many shortcomings of classic and contemporary books. Classical/contemporary books from the Middle East and West. Especially the writings of Murtadha Mutahhari such as Theory of Knowledge, When Love Lands and many others as well as other eastern thinkers whose writings have not been included here. Even thinkers from the West still have many writings that have not been included here. For the sake of educating the nation's children, I think this application needs book updates"
"Thank you ipusnas the books are very helpful. Oh yes, the newly added books please make them searchable using the search feature, because there are many new books that are good but hard to find using that feature."
Applications often have problems loading
"Just downloaded, can't open the trash app"
The application lacks the highlighter.
I can't enter. The writing has a problem retrieving data. Then also no DLS
Can not be opened
Is the application having problems? I tried to open the book but couldn't because of an error and now I uninstalled and then reinstalled it can't be opened
"It's cool even though it's given a limit, at least it makes a trigger for the reading pen"
Why is my account deactivated??
Ô∏è
"Alhamdulillah, the application is very helpful in finding learning materials. If I may give input, add a specific word search feature in reading a book so that if there is certain material that the reader wants to find, the reader will have no difficulty, especially if the book has a lot of pages. Furthermore, for textbooks that make readers often queue to borrow, please increase the number üôè. Excited for the development of this app! I was very helpful. Thank youüòä"
The service library is cool
"In the past, the application was fine, for some reason, since a few days ago, I couldn't access the book, I wanted to borrow it but everything was always out of stock, and I couldn't borrow it all the time. Please, why can it be like this, I find it very difficult to do my college assignments. I ask the person concerned for help"
"The application is good and very useful during a pandemic like now, but it would be better if the book you want to borrow can be seen at least the list of contents because in my experience the title of the book we are looking for may not have the contents as expected. So if you can see the table of contents, you can at least know whether the book is appropriate or not. Thank you"
"Very good application, very useful for reading, but please remove the loan and loan feature, the book is also digital, when there is a borrowing system, and there is an end, or 5 days. We may have references for lectures, papers, theses... Please feature 5 days, borrow and delete the system, yes, if it's like a normal download, we want to be bookworms but we don't have the money to buy books"
There are no books that I can borrow/open. All the books don't show up
"The application cannot be used, please fix it, I need it for my school assignment, thank youüôè"
"Why does this app make me salty, it's really loadinggg"

"why can't I log in using my fb account or email?? can't read the book, please. How is it"
Frequent errors and can't be opened
The application often has errors and many books are still on loan

"Thank God I was able to register. But there is no email verification notification, nor is it in spam. So you still can't borrow books"
Can't open what's the problem?
"Sorry in advance, is Ipusnas currently under maintenance? Since yesterday it can't be accessed, I can't even log in. Thank you üôè"
"I can't open it, I uninstalled it and then installed it again, so I tried it on 2 of my cellphones, both of them didn't work, so please fix it üôè"
"Good applications the books are varied. A little input for developers for the reading display would be even better if it was made like a google playbook, because it looks more realistic. For the current display, I don't think it's good, the font can't be set and the dark background doesn't work. Thank you and keep going."
"Why is there no sign up section now just log in? And logging in is always difficult even though my internet is very stable and fast, please help"
"Nafa try it first, thank you"
"there is another problem when borrowing books, the description of the book does not appear and cannot borrow the books on the shelf cannot be returned even though the loan period has expired, please fix it"

"min, please fix the appk, I had to install then uninstall it again then install it again yesterday Still can be accessed now can't anymore. Even though this app is very useful, it's just the app that needs to be improved again üôèüôèüò≠üòå"
"Since a few days ago the application can not be used. Even though I've been back and forth installing - uninstalling, the description of the book doesn't appear and the borrow button can't be clicked. So it's like 0 everything. Then this morning, can't get in. Loading continues on the Ipusnas logo page, doesn't enter the timeline. I wonder why? :(("
The first time I downloaded ipusnas very smoothly... but the second time I entered I couldn't do it at all. Please keep waiting
"Thank you Alhamdulillah, very useful. It's easy to find useful ebooks"
Why does ipusnas always have problems again and again?? uninstall and install many times still the same. What's the solution?
"My network is smooth, but the application keeps loading, please fix it"
"Can't borrow books,"
"I'm looking for the book Let's be smart, the author is Anita Hairunnisa, why isn't it on Ipusnas?"
"Min, please fix it, how come I can't log in, there's even a warning that a server error has occurred"
"How come I can't read the book because I haven't registered yet even though I've already registered and if I want to borrow the first error even though the network is good, please fix it"
The application is good. But please increase the number of books especially for students
Why is there no email verification yet
"What is this app.... Say, the most complete application has orders, the one with complete government photos is here, we can't download the book, we don't have a lot of books, there are all mr4h2n books... Regret downloading this app.."
Can't open
"Very good, but now why is there an error"
Why do I have to install and uninstall three times but when I open the application an error always occurs and it says it can't retrieve data from the server. Admin please fix it üôè
Why can't the details of the book be found when I'm glad there's an online library... How come I can't even borrow it

"Please fix the application again, it keeps getting errors :))"
make it easy.
"Thank you iPusnas, hopefully it will be even better in the future and add more collections and features and make it easier."
Nice app
"If you want to borrow a book, you have to wait in a long and long queue. The number of books should be increased or use the system after reading the book again so that the others don't have to wait long"
"I have a problem when I want to enter it says 'NO DLS', what do you mean, bro??"
"Why did IPusnas run smoothly before, now it seems like I often get errors like that. Please fix it bro Ô∏è"
"The application often crashes. It's too bad. It's been borrowed, suddenly the loan isn't there, the book I want to see can't be opened."
"Is it really difficult to open, for example, the book category? Is my signal not good enough?"
Not accessibleüò•
"""Unable to retrieve data from server and no DLS"" what does this mean?"
Why can't I open it :')
Very helpful
Can't be accessed
"Min, how come the Ipusnas can't be accessed today, bro?"
"Sorry in advance, why is Ipusnas still having problems on the server/DLS? Even though my network is good, I beg of the parties to fix it immediately, I really need a book nowüôè"
"Unfortunately, there is no last read feature. So, if you enter again, you have to scroll down. That's if you remember. But, good at all because I can read the novel that I was curious in it."
I downloaded it but can't open the apk. there is always a problem occurs. server can't fetch data from server and no DLS. close apk? why can't I open it I really need a book
"Nice app, and very helpfulÔ∏è"
Very nice.
"Min app, please fix it. I even installed the app hoping for a miracle. Opened okay, it still works, search is smooth, but why does the HBs stop loading, the display doesn't show identity & book availability, the borrow button is difficult? Sometimes it's hard to get in. If the problem is in my signal it's impossible. thnks"
Setting error when needed and very annoying
Really like the ipusnas application. The collection is complete and there are many copies
"Why can't I access the app? Even though my network is good, last week I could still access it but 2 days ago I couldn't access it at all. I've uninstalled the app and reinstalled it but it still doesn't change."
"Min, how come after downloading I can't login? The writing cannot be downloaded or the server is not downloaded (DLS) please solve it"
book category not showing
"The collection of books is large, it's free, so it's economical..."
"Finally, there is also the apk, thank you very much for helping me find books on my cellphone‚ù§"
üëç
ok ok
"Can read as many books as possible, thank you ipusnas"
Ipusnas is a good ebook application My suggestion is to give a wishlist tool so it's easy to find if you want to borrow the next day..
"Sorry, why can't this be opened because there is no DLS, right? Please help"
"Thank you iPusnas, this application is very useful ... helping people who like to read but don't want to spend money to buy books. However, it would be better if the reading mode could be scrolled by simply pressing the volume button."
I'll give you 4 first
The collection of reading books is quite complete üëçüôå
"Sorry, I like to use ipusnas but why do I often have problems opening it?"
"I thank Mr. Ma'ruf Amin as vice president and professor of Indonesia, I have read a book that really inspired me, thank you"

THIS APPLICATION IS NOT ERRORS FROM THE FIRST WANT TO READ THE BOOK IS HARD
"morning ! I first installed ipusnas. but why can't you open the apk? ""no dls"" please help"
"I gave a rating of 4, yesterday it was accessible, how come today it can't. Please, Ipusnas, I really need books on Ipusnas, but why can't it be accessed, ""the server and no DLS"" he said. When can it be accessed again, O Ipusna, please I need a book for research üôèüôèüôè"
"Sorry why the aps doesn't want to be accessed, even though my network is quite stable"
Can not be opened
"Why can't it be opened? Hey, it's not good quality."
Thank you very much and really being a coffee friend
"Very helpful, especially for students, especially for distance learning which is automatically difficult to access the campus library"
"it's quite comfortable, it's just that sometimes it loads frequently, and suddenly exits the application. Playbooks are still more comfortable for now than Ipusnas and try to keep the books filled, hopefully they can be filled with the latest books."
"Very bad, asking permission is too suspicious and very sensitive"
THE TRANSLATION NOVEL IS FINALLY UPDATED!!!!!! THE BEST IPUSNAS!!! keep on multiplying it... so I don't get bored reading on ipusnas... thank you!!!
"Min, how come the application can't be opened and it says no DLS..??"
"Why can't I login / log in to read the book. PdhL I have downloaded and logged in through my fb account, but I can't... Tks.üôè"
"Don't borrow the digital book for only 3 days.... Hihi... I'm a wfh, so if you read novels in your spare time... For entertainment when you're bored, watching work while PSBB doesn't finish, can't go... Heheh"
"The app asks for an update, after the update the display doesn't change. What has changed is, the book that was just borrowed, only got part of it, not yet finished, in fact all of it was lost. even though there are books that are queued for weeks, guys. Not encouraging."
"Very useful, but I'm sorry, bro, why can't I login now? Still can't login, min, using email fails to keep asking for repairs, because during a pandemic like this, Ipusnas is very helpful"
Really good
"Thank you iPunas.. a very useful new breakthrough. Well, reduce my spending numbers to buy physical books. Indeed, there are still features that need to be further developed, such as the collection of books that need to be reproduced and the search field that needs a bit of development. Hopefully in the future iPusnas will grow for the sake of Indonesian intelligence üòä."
Enough
Thank you this application really helps my knowledge
"Good and very useful for many people, and the books are very good and suitable as references for college assignments and others."
Good application
Books are not updated
"Alhamdulillah so far there have been no problems.. But please add more available book stock and a variety of Islamic books, please multiply.."
I am very happy with ipusnas because I can read interesting stories to my children
"I'm a bit annoyed that it's difficult to register, even if I can't do it, please wait for it, because it's difficult and I can uninstall it again. I hope it's fixed"

"Thank you the app is good. However, it is better if the number of books on science is increased."
"Thanks, very useful for college students like me"
"I love how crazy this application is... Even though the book is good. But the problem is that it always doesn't open normally due to technical reasons... Please fix it again, so that when you need it, you can use it"
"I like this application, but please, Pramoedya Ananta Toer's work is equipped with a period of application, only about revolution, besides that, please add books by Mark Manson, Emma Goldman and others because this apk lacks motivational books."
Often it doesn't load even though my network is really good
How come it can't be opened.. it always says an error occurred on the server and there are no dls.. how can this be.. even though today Pjj needs a book to make a review..
Why suddenly this application can not be opened. BEFORE IT'S VERY CLEAR
hello sis. I've downloaded ipusnas but it's not logged in because the server and DLS don't exist. How are you? Please help
"Mantaaappp,,, the collection is very large, my house is in an area that doesn't have a regional library,, even if there is, the location is very far,, thanks Ipusnas, the collection is cool, although there are some books that have to be queued,"
"Why else, I want to read Ipusnas, but all blank pages take so long to load."
"Afternoon! I've already installed it before, but when I uninstalled it, I installed it again, but why can't it be opened? Please help, when I open it there is a ""no dls"" warning like that, please help üòä Thank you"
"Ah, really like it anyway. I hope the book collection is expanded, Min"
"The search tool doesn't work, if we write math subjects for grade 5 to 2013 curriculum, what comes out is even a variety of books, the book we're looking for doesn't exist. What is written is always x, what application is this, how come it says the central library, just processing the data, the application is stupid"
"The application is very good, the collection of books is large. We as driving teachers in the interior of Papua are greatly helped by this apk. But if it is possible, the loan period will be extended because access to the network in the interior is very difficult (later the city will be able to access it)."
"Finally, I don't need to buy physical books and I don't need to buy ebooks either! can borrow legally here, yash. the sea queue for telling stories and other books that I was after was really long, duh. i cant wait. Hopefully in the future there will be a feature that can highlight sentences, right? haha. Thank you. <3"
How do you register for new users? There is only a log in button. It's so annoying
Great! Only the book is incomplete but I like it
very helpful if you are writing a thesis that you are confused about borrowing a book all the time
"This application is very useful. Very interesting reading interest, especially young people throughout Indonesia with the e-book facilities provided. I can access the Ipusnas application according to the solution provided. Ipusnas Literacy Greetings!!! I give 5 stars‚úä‚úä"
nice app. it's just that on my device (chrome book) it can't be full screen in landscape mode. hopefully the next update can be full screen so it's easy to use like a google play book.
"Give a place for the list of favorite books, so you don't have to bother looking for it again, the book can be borrowed a maximum of 2, it's not enough, you can add 5-6, it's definitely fun"
"Come on, regret downloading"
"I installed how come it can't even be opened? it says ""unable to open server data and no DLS. close application?"". how is that?"
"I am happy with this application, because it can make it easier for me to borrow reference books that are difficult to get. But it would be nice, the developer can increase the collection of books and there are also some books that don't exist even though the book is famous. Don't forget the quality level of the app! Spirit!!"
Assalamu'alaikum... Why is there an error when it's time out?
"Admin, please update the search again, I searched for Sociology textbooks instead, books for elementary school children, History and PPKN appeared"
"I like this apk, it has a large collection of books, but over time the books cannot be borrowed even though there are still a lot of stock. I've uninstalled and reinstalled but still can't borrow books. please fix it again, it's a shame because I'm already comfortable with this app"
Hopefully the collection will be more complete and the availability of books will be added. Can be very useful because books are getting more expensive day by day.
"Actually this is very useful. But why do you often get errors like that? I want to borrow so I can't. Even though the internet is smooth :( please fix it, I really like this application. Thank you"
"Why can't I login, and always error like no DLS..help I don't understand"
really helped me to find references for my thesis. Thank you ipusnas
Sometimes I can't open books from Ipusnas. Can't borrow. Why is that? :(
"Hello ipusnas. I want to open the application, but I can't, before I was able to"
"Maybe it's been 4 years since I've used this apk, it's good and complete. Also, when I read a novel here, I don't feel guilty like if I read a plagiarized ebook that is usually spread around like that. But unfortunately the apk is still unstable, I don't know why sometimes it gets errors, maybe the bug is still not fixed."
"Overall good, but lately I have to download every time I read. Please enlighten"
"I can't download the book, it's really bad even though before it was updated it wasn't like this"
"Yes, thank you, at first I couldn't borrow it but when I verified my email, the book could be borrowed. Thank you, I'm satisfied, even though I can't download and screenshot üòä"
"Very useful, reducing spending to buy physical books üëç Then I had a lot of wishlist books there, just waiting in line and finally able to read the book. Unfortunately, many features that it feels need to be improved. First, the search feature when reading the novel doesn't work. Second, the bookmark feature that for some reason can't be used, even though it's the most useful. Third, the way of reading cannot be changed, right? How come it's just scrolling, there should be something sliding."
"I think the application is really good. But, in my opinion, the appearance of the application is very boring and looks old-fashioned. However, the collection is quite complete."
"Thank you, the problem is solved"
Can't borrow books!
"Dear iPusnas, I object to too few borrowing modes. For example, there are only a dozen books, but the queue is up to 4000. Then when can I borrow it!!"
"Please borrow the book, the time is slightly extended, so you don't download it again."
"Please let me know whether Ipusnas can't be installed on a PC or laptop? I've been trying to install it but it didn't work, thanks"
How come it can't be opened?
Please add more to your collection of translated novels..
Why is the verification not sent to the email? very strange how can I borrow
"why are there so many shortcomings, often come out on their own, every time you want to read a book it always lags, it's unclear and keeps coming out on its own even though the quota and signal are full, the intention is to read it can't even auto install"
"The book I want doesn't exist, so I have to read something else (which I've read) so please update it"
"I've installed the application and I've also logged in with my account, how come when I want to read I can't, even though there are many books that interest me and I want to borrow them to read but because I can't install it again :("
Best application
Very nice
Force close when I want to read
"Sorry, why can't I open the apk? Unable to fetch data from server and no DLS available. Explanation please."
"I'm sorry, Sis, please add lots of school books, for example physics books, etc. or the books are updated with old books... well, if you have them, it's definitely cool"
"Hello IPusnas! why can't I login? It says ""Unable to retrieve data from server"", even though yesterday it went smoothly please fix it immediately."
"The collection of books is increasing, varied, very useful, hopefully it will continue to grow, Ipusnas, libraries are in hand.üëçüëç"
I'm a bit disappointed that I can't log in because I don't have DLS and can't transfer data. Even though the initial download time is still possible. How can I log in again?
"I really like the application, but I beg your permission lately, I can't use this apk every time I want to read a book that I borrowed, the apk comes out right away, please provide a solution, thank you"
That's really good. It's just that for a pdf player the interface is still not good. Hopefully it can be improved more
Why can't it be read? Application error (stopped) continues. Please solve
it's hard to enter even though it's already entered by a pesbuk
"Thank you for the response, it can be used and still trying"
"I have a lot of complaints, when I can't get my password, after that I can do it again and I want to borrow the book but I can't? Why, what's wrong, I'm already logged in with my account How come I still can't I haven't read the book so far because I can't read it Even though I'm interested in the story, just uninstall it"
Why can't I open iPusnas? even though i could use it before
"The application is good, it's just that sometimes the application lags... please optimize it more, pleaseüôèüèª"
"It's so bad, the book is not complete"
Why can't you login? .. The text that appears: Fail An error occurred Try again. I've tried many times but still can't..
"Even though the email has been created, confirmed, the profile has also been set up, but it keeps failing to borrow books.. how do you do it please??"
"Yesterday the app was really good. Now the error continues to be disappointing, sis. Hopefully it will be fixed as soon as possible üôè ."
"how come I can't open the app, it says DLS"
"The application is okay, but it's like an iPusnas class, the book collection isn't complete, for regional and urban economics books, it's not open at all"
"Selected a book, borrowed it, downloaded it, crashed... The app has stopped!"
"good, but not complete, stock is also limited. For new users, it might be quite difficult to get books, because they don't get any."
"I just found out, there are books that don't appear when we search. Even though on the first page there is a book. For example, Hamka books, on the first page, there are human echo publications, lots of them. But when I search for the title of the book or the hamka, it doesn't appear. How .... This is very unfortunate you know. Maybe those who complain that the collection isn't complete, because when you search for the book it doesn't appear, even though maybe the book is there. I found ""Mr Director"" when I wanted to cr again, I didn't even see it."
"very useful, good, free, the book is quite complete, there is even a translated book. The advice is to fix the format to make it more comfortable, like in a play book"
very often errors. even though I borrowed the book but it can't appear even though I really need it
DLS server Error something. Even though the books needed to study during a pandemic are at Ipusnas. Unfortunately Ipusnas is not fully supported this time. Please kindly fix this app for us
why the error continues now it's never smooth
"Please, why does this error continue, I can't enter the apk. Even though it's important to look for references"
"Hi ipusnas, is there an error in the app? Why does it keep loading even though my internet connection is fine."
Gudboy
I don't know how to use itüòå
"The PC version of the iPusnas application installer contains a trojan virus which was detected using Kaspersky antivirus. The details of the virus are as follows: ""Object name HEUR: Trojan-PSW.Win32.Xploder.gen Object type Trojan program"" According to Kaspersky's explanation, the Trojan-PSW (Password stealing ware) type of Trojan virus is a virus designed to steal user account information such as logins and passwords. Please explain..why do official government apps infiltrate user info hacker virus?"
"What is this, a garbage application, my cellphone has 6gb of ram still often force closes, can't download even though I want to read it, how can I be diligent in reading the reading tool doesn't support it"
The application is good.... The intellectual life of the nationü§£ü§£ü§£
"So, when the book is about to be opened, it suddenly exits the application and there is a notification that the book cannot be opened. After 2 days, the book can be opened"
Cool
Please improve the book application more üôè
That's the point
I often read the front page and then go to sleep and wake up surprised and then read the last page
"There are a lot of errors, wanting to leave a comment, it keeps failing. Please adjust the genre category of the book. Even though this app is good"
"Very satisfied, many choices of books"
"How come the reading mode display has changed? The feeling was not like this before. Honestly, it's hard to read. Then now you can't change the reading display anymore, it's not like before."
Is there a PC version or not?
"I think this application is good and very useful, but unfortunately the book/novel collection is not complete, for example Tere Liye's novel, even though it is a top novel. Then the stock of books is very, very limited. My advice, please, be more complete, both the collection and the stock so that users don't have to queue for long. That is all and thank you"
Disappointed that there are very few important history books
"Ohhhh... the application is still very messy, the books can't be read, the error comes out on its own. Please fix this, because it really helps in developing Indonesian literacy. I also want to be a novelist so I have to read a lot too, but what about the application?"
"I think this application is good enough. I just want to give a little advice. It would be better if Ipusnas provided a reading feature. So it's not just a borrowing feature. So if someone runs out of books because they have been borrowed, they can still read. Yes, the system is like an offline library where we can read and borrow."
How do you get this apk ready. Borrow email verification even though it's better to just install it
Error keeps feelingüó£Ô∏è
"Unfortunately, there is still an empty book, please complete it more but it's great üëç"
Not enough
"Thank you iPusnas for presenting fairly complete readings and various categories, but if I may give you a suggestion, it would be better if the queue feature is sorted by queue number, not who gets it fast, or can be notified directly when the book you are looking for is available without having to open the application. before."
play
"Sorry in advance why when I open the iupunas application there is an error that says an error has occurred and can't load data I want to be fixed immediately because I need it for my reading, thank you."
"Please add more Japanese manga/comic books, I'll give you 5 stars later"
"Great features, although sometimes the table of contents feature isn't there, but the bookmark feature can still cover up its shortcomings üëç"
"How come there is an error if you want to borrow a book. Please fix it. During the pandemic it's hard to find books because the library is closed, looking online is getting harder and harder"
Love it
"I just downloaded the application and when I opened it, it said ""unable to retrieve data from server and no DLS."" Why is that?"
"Actually I want to give 3 stars, because the application keeps crashing, I want to return the book but I can't, I reinstalled it still doesn't work, so I uninstalled it, even though I really need it :( and many old books are not returned, so the queues won't work Can I borrow it, please, when it's time to return it, it will return automatically, so you don't feel bad for those who are queuing but being hanged."
"I can't open the application after installing, please improve the application again"
"Please explain why when I re-installed Ipusnas there was a statement that I couldn't retrieve data from the server and there was no DLS, I want to borrow a book for my assignment. Please fix it as soon as possible so it doesn't continue like this!"
The app is good. Recommended for students to make additional references.
Please develop the application again
"Ipusnas, now you can't take screenshots, can you? Why?"
Feel safe and comfortable reading legal ebooks
"How come I can't borrow the book. When I borrow it, it says your email hasn't been confirmed. That's just how it is"
"Please, increase the stock of books. Especially books for students. Keep waiting in line if you want piijem."
Why can't it be opened...?
"There's another problem, please fix the ipusnas immediately"
"I have 2 devices. HP 1 installed ipusnas safe and secure. HP 2 can't log in, it says it failed to retrieve data from the server or there is a DLS error. After all, it's a DLS error."
"The book is fairly complete but it's a shame that it still needs improvement so that it will be better in the future because I'm having a problem ""can't retrieve data from the server and no DLS, close the application?"""
"Assalamualaikum, sorry, why can't the application be opened, even though I have updated it."
Ugly can't be opened
Force close when you want to read
So much work ah
Can't login at all
Great for online reading
"Please fix the system, the book cannot be borrowed, because of a network error. Even though the signal is smooth, for other applications it can. Please fix"
"""Unable to retrieve data from server and no DLS"" why is that?"
"Sis, why is Ipusnas always getting an error, I've been wanting to open it, I can't, I've uninstalled it and installed it again, it still doesn't want to, it says it can't retrieve data"
"internet connection ok, storage ok, open app? nope. it's just getting worse ipusnas :("
"The application has an error, it can't open.. Please fix it ASAP"
How come you can't open it?
"I can't login, and when I reopen the apps. Always showing can't fetch data from server & no DLS. That's why huh? tried repeatedly but always like that."
why iPusnas? The book is readable. Even though it's very important
Why have I downloaded it but when it is opened it can't retrieve data from the server and no DLS?
"An error when opening the borrow book page, a description of the network timeout error even though the internet connection is smooth."
"I just downloaded this apk again after changing my cellphone, but after installing the apk, how come the apk can't be opened, please, how do I do thisüôè"
"Why is the Ipusnas an error, please fix it. It's very important, it can't even be opened"
There have been improvements.. hopefully in the future it will be even better
"Oops, why is this error all the time? It's really important, ahhh, ha, disillusioned!"
"Oops, why can't I open the app, huh??"
Why can't I log in? Is ipusNas an error? Explanation please
nice
Very petrified to find references during the pandemic
ok
"Why can't I mark the page I've read (the bookmark can't be used) specifically for the book entitled ""Indonesian master"". Please explain üôèüôèüôè"
frequent errors
This is why Ipusnas cannot be opened. Please help
"Hello iTunes, I'm Jewish üòä very helpful for my daily campus assignments üôè Thank you"
"I can't do it yet, I'm still dizzy with strangersüòÇ"
"Sorry, I just downloaded it, I can't use it."
A little bit of maintenance.... a little bit of maintenance. Maintenance terooosss... greatüò£üò£üò£üò£
great
"i like this app. the only drawback is on a device with a keyboard, the page cannot be opened with the direction keys, it can only be done with the touchpad."
I think the book is lacking
"Disappointed üò≠ Registration is difficult. Even though this is the first time you have registered, you can say that your email has already been used. After using a new email again, it still doesn't work. Remember, there is a picture of the President in it. Use the President's name, don't disappoint. Hopefully it can be improved."
"Thank you for making it easier for me to learn through this application, with the applications found on mobile phones and laptops, it makes it easier for users to read anywhere. My advice is that the apk on the laptop is more updated. Because I think the time used to process/borrow reading books is a bit slow."
"That's great, the e-book is quite complete"
"Hi, Ipusnas! Thank God, there are no more problems, oh yes, there are lots of textbooks on Indonesian literature, okay(:"
"Why is this apk strange, right, when you want to borrow a book, you automatically lose the apk directly. It's urgent"
Keep up the good work üëçüèø
"Thank you very much, the apk really helped us for students, it's just related to the queue for borrowing books which in my opinion makes it lazy to borrow, there are a lot of queues, maybe more than one book is provided, so we don't have to queue too much, you can use the driver, it can be duplicated, maybe it takes a little evaluation regarding the availability and number of books available, sorry if I'm wrong, thank you"
"Can't borrow a book, even though I've verified my email"
"This application is very good for the people of Indonesia. Especially for students who are constrained by the cost of buying textbooks. This application can be used as a reference for learning references for students in Indonesia. because they can borrow books for free here. This application can increase public insight and increase interest in reading Indonesian people. In addition, we can read books in this application offline so it saves internet quota very much."
"Please add more lecture books, almost everything I searched is missing, if possible, books related to heredity and so on, add more books on the interpretation method... Thank you so much"
"Hello ipusnas, why haven't you been able to login and enter the application for a few days? The writing is only that the server cannot retrieve DLS data, please fix it immediately"
"Unable to open, ""unable to retrieve data from server"""
"Ipusnas is broken, isn't it? I can't open the app? I wonder why?"
"It's really difficult to connect, even though the connection is smooth"
"I really like this app, it really helps me to read free books."
Unable to retrieve raw data
"Why can't it be opened?, the text can't retrieve data. Even though I've downloaded and uninstalled it many times"
"The download hasn't even been a week, but the application has been error-free"
Why is my account getting an error? Please fix again
"Why has the app been lagging lately, it can't be openedü§î"
"Min, how come I can't log in, it says can't receive data from the server, how do you do it"

"Ipusnas, I want to login, how come I can't, it makes me really annoyed it says there is no dsl or whatever it's more important ""how come it's like this"
"Lately, the app often crashes"
Really good
"For very poor livelihoods and books on lectures are limited, as well as the availability of 0 books every day"
"I want to search for books using various keywords, why can't I?"
I'm excited to have more books
"In the search column nothing came out at all the book I was looking for, even though I saw the tutorial on youtube, it came out but this is the opposite, I'm disappointed"
Hello brother.... I really like this application. But unfortunately the book search column is very difficult to display the results. What else is the problem?? Give 4 stars first
How come you can't contact the server?
"Initially this application was good, only the books for lectures were incomplete. After all, there was an error when I was about to open the application, please enlighten me what should I do so that Ipusnas on my device can be reopened.üôè"
Cannot enter the app. There's always an error.
"Hello ipusnas, why does the application often error? Even my account often goes out by itself"
Apk error boss
"Please, why does it keep getting errors. Can't be opened. The collection is small. Disappointing. Even though it's a national library"
"I can't log in to ipusnas,, ""unable to retrieve data from server"" I've changed providers, still can't log in. Is the server down? I'm very uncomfortable"
"Errors often occur, it also takes a long time to load....please improve againüôè"
Not receiving data from the server continues min

"Disappointed, I swear the book at night can't be opened, where do you want to work... please add more books"
"Thank you iPusnas, with iPusnas borrowing books is easier"
So good. Hopefully the book collection continues to grow.
"Hello iPusnas, thank you for this good and useful application // A few suggestions, if you can add more good non-fiction books such as Rich Dad Poor Dad, Men are from Mars Women are from Venus, Anne Frank Diary, Totto Chan too books by authors like Gary Chapman, Daniel Kahneman, Meik Wiking, etc. // That's it. Hohoho Thank you iPusnas, keep going"
"With this app, hobbies make it easier to channel them"
great app
"Good application, this proves that the government is here to be able to increase the reading level of people who are far behind with other countries"
Really good
"How come there is an error loading the book details, the network timeout continues even though the network is running smoothly. Please fix it, I really need it"
"How come I can't login, minüò¢ ""can't retrieve data from the server, and there's no DLS"""
"After being updated on October 17, 2020, the network error is even though the quota is still 30, so when I open this app it goes down. Please fix the bug"
"Why is it that when I want to search for a book, the application returns to the start page, right? How about this. Please guide"
"Please complete books for students, not just children's books"
It's hard to log in to the account. The book should also be added
"Hello Ipusnas! I really like this application. The books are good, many, and okay. Please complete the collection again. His comics too, including the Next-G comic. And in the library, please group the children's books. I like KKPK, PCPK, Enid Blyton the most, Tere Liye, etc. But I don't like book pages with sample text. Sometimes there is only the cover and no pages, and the bookmarks cannot be used. The number of copies of the books has also been increased, thank you...ü§ó"
"Min, please increase the collection, especially novels, poetry collections. Thanks."
"Tired of looking for the pages you want to read if you have a lot of book pages one by one, please make tools, for example, if you have a good collection of books, please"

Excellent
"How come the state application sucks, scratch anjimm. Why do you suck at making public services?"
Dip
"For development, if the book you want to borrow is in the queue, and it has reached the queue number, please, maybe a notification can be made outside the app, because we don't always have it in the app and sometimes we forget. Please add more book collections, also add international magazines and journals (if you can, hehe). (Edit: because the number of Ipusnas visitors is increasing, please increase the stock of books too). Thanks for this awesome app. Greetings literacy!"
"Helped, just hope the app can be improved again"
"I don't know why I can't download books that have been borrowed, even though the network is good. Even the cover of the book can't look completely blue :("
Nice app
"Thank you, so I can read online books from home for free without having to leave the house during the pandemic. Good luck for the future"
"When you want to borrow a book, why do you always have a loading error, even though the signal is good?"
"I've been in this app a few months ago. So far I like this app and its services. But why now do I have to enter another e-mail. Once a week or once every two weeks gt. I forgot. But I don't get asked to enter an e-mail often sy. and i also don't want to ask, how do you return a DLS book or it hasn't been downloaded but it's already in the loan column.. please help. I hope Ipusnas will be even better.. and more users.. tq for the service :)"
"Keep it up, it's really good.. add more to your collection of books, sis.. about phone calls if you can. thank you"
"Please increase the number of books, especially fiction novels that are borrowed a lot. because sometimes the queue can be very long."
very top
"Even though it's usually smooth ""just make it but why is it finally"" why can't it? Unknown error mulu :'( Edit: finally it runs smoothly again.... Thankyou ipusnas ‚ù§Ô∏è."
"There are quite a lot of books, but sometimes the application error, the response is slow"
*Edited* Thank you! It's running smoothly and there are no more errors.
"Create a pandemic, increase knowledge"
"Many lecture books are not available, search results often do not relate to the keywords entered, the books listed on the front page like to change positions and titles, so it's a bit confusing. Hopefully it can be improved in the future so that readers are comfortable, especially during the pandemic we really need ebooks. That is all and thank you."
"Why can't the apk be opened, it can't even retrieve data/no DLS. Please, bro, is there a problem with the apk or what?"
"How come it can't be opened.....every time you want to open the application it always comes out, can't load data, please try again"
"Please fix the problem, can't open the application. Always appears failed to retrieve data from the server Please fix it"
Why can't the application be opened?
"Why the first error, min. It's really hard to even play around like that, I can't open the ebook when I want to borrow it. Initial install even though it's smooth. Please fix it, even though the app is really good."
"Very helpful, thank you"
"Fix it can be multi-tasking because when you just open another application while reading, you have to reload from the beginning. If you go back to the ipusnas application. It's no fun having to re-open it looking for the last page read, even though it can be pinned/marked"
"Good application, hopefully the collection will be further improved"
"It's updated instead of getting better, it's even decreasing in quality. I'm really disappointed even though I'm still needed during a pandemic like this. Please fix again"
"Very good for those who like to read books, very suitable"
Errors that can't be opened are always bug errors
"Can't take a screenshot, it's too much to make an application. We don't want to hijack books or anything, we just want to save the excerpts for note"
Why is there too much access when only reading?
"I think it's good, but for ebooks and journals, please add them, thank you"
"Really good. Here I can borrow any book. As long as the book is there, yes. Anyway it's really ok"
Can't log in
Rich knowledge
"The drawback, in my opinion, is that there isn't an alarm for returning books, so if you're queuing for books, you have to be careful. My advice is to alarm the book return notification, because I've been queuing for up to two months. Every time I look at the book, it turns out to have been taken. Thank you"
Why can't I login using Facebook?
"Please fix it in the search field + add more collections of books, specifically for lectures.. No need for comics or fiction, it's ugly.. this belongs to the government, right? It must be repaired immediately in order to increase the reading interest of the Indonesian people who are still low... so it's easy to eat hoaxes! Thank you.. the stars will be added as the improvement.."
Very helpful
What's more
üëç
"I can borrow books online, when I want to open my apps, I often close the apps myself"
Can't open it already downloaded the apk
"Why can't the application be opened? An error always occurs. Please fix it, admin"
"At first I really enjoyed using this application, but lately, why is it difficult to access and there is always a notification ""unable to retrieve data from server and dls"" even this time I can't login at all, if there are problems, please fix it asap and thank you"
"I can't log in many times it says the server has a problem. I have reported it to ipusnas instagram, no answer"
"Why is there a problem and I've tried to log in many times , even though it's really needed"
"This application is very good, the book collection is also complete"
"I don't know my internet connection is stable, I don't know from the signal or from the apküò≠why is it so hard to download huhuhow do I really need this apk for work."
How come it can't be opened? Then it says DLS not found?
"I really like it if there is money from taxes that can be used by the people to access information and knowledge like this. Although sometimes there are some annoyances, such as queues for books that are limited in number even though the requests are many, sometimes they like to log out, at most they fail to log in again when there is server maintenance. Do you want to use the notes feature along with the appearance of the book you are reading, can you not? So the records are not separate. Just that. Hopefully it will grow!"
Why is Ipusnas asking for camera access and asking for access can change system settings even though in use it has nothing to do with the camera. Also why do system settings have to be given permission to be able to change?
"Just try it later, when it's good, just add it"
I have also installed it but can't log in
"Very cool, complete..very useful...thank you."
"Good and very helpful for literacy lovers! The novels are very complete, ranging from translated and popular novels, to even series novels! It's really cool!!"
Excellent
Add curriculum 13 education books and the loan period is extended so that it can be 30 days
"I just installed it, and when I was looking for the book it wasn't complete, and the book ran out all the time"
Can't borrow books
Ô∏è
Jesus bless you
Please give more budget so that the book you want to read doesn't take too long
"bug. Twice error. Every error, g can be used for a full day. But because there are more and more errors, I give 3 for the facilities. Thank you. Can read for free. Oh yeah, don't take the political element into it. Thank you."
Read free & legal books
Very good for those of you who like to read books
Very nice
"Hi ipusnas, for books that can be quoted, why is the bookmark not working? When I go out and want to read again, I return to the first page. Please help"
"An application that deserves to be owned by everyone here, we make it easier to find quality books, I really like the ipusnas apk, hopefully the collection of books is getting more and more complete and complete..."
"I already installed it, but I want to login, how come I can't:')"
Try increasing the book borrowing limit to 30 days
"Please add more books so you can really feel at home in Ipusnas. And help the writers of illegal ebooks, too. Mas and Mbak Admin and the government, please share more books, especially novels (hehe) at Ipusnas, okay? #ilikeipusnas #successterusya"
"Admin of iPusnas, can you access book borrowing without using a queue and can be accessed at any time. I need to read the book immediately to study online. I will really appreciate it if iPusnas provides a solution that benefits all parties. Thank you"
FF game dotted
The app likes to come out on its own
Why can't I borrow books now.. it always shows up telling me to check my inbox.. but there's no notification in my inbox.. please fix it @ipusnas
"Complete good ... But playing why if you want to borrow a book that comes out, the account verification has not yet been verified even though it's already min"
Cool apps
"Why can't I borrow a book, even though before I could"
Bismillahirrohmanirrohhim
Thanks for the response and repair of the system damage Ô∏è I hope the books can be added again
"5 stars for the application because you can read books for free, practically, and legally during the pandemic. 1 star because the splash screen contains political elements, which is not appropriate for Pusnas as an educational institution to install it. Some time ago I used iPusnas not yet, recently it appeared. It is better to remove the political element as a form of professionalism. Or has Pusnas started to be used as a political tool? Only Allah and the developers know."
Broken application to login is also difficult
very helpful
Very useful and helpful in lectures
"Why is the application not opening for me? Even though the application is good, but the error is when I try to uninstall and then install it again, it still can't be opened. Hopefully it will be fixed soon"
"Thanks for the application. But why is the email verification message not showing up in my inbox. I've tried more than 3 times but still not showing up. I've been looking for it still can't. This makes it difficult for me to be able to borrow books. Admin, please."
"Hello ipusnas. Thank you for providing many books that have helped my study. If I may suggest about the ss feature which now can't be used on ipusnas. Can you add features such as quoting text and making it an image with a watermark from ipusnas itself? I had trouble finding references and happened to find them on Ipusnas, unfortunately my coursework required proof of the citation. So many suggestions from me, once again thank you ipusnas ^^"
"It's never been updated, the application is the same as the heat. So the quality of the application is not good"
"Min, I want to ask why the PC-only app is difficult to access, aka opening, it won't appear? It's been a few days like that"
"The book in the app is valid. As much as possible Avoid pirated books. My suggestion is that if you can increase the collection of reading books, such as novels, so that it is not difficult to find novels in the application."
"I borrowed a book and it has been downloaded but when I want to read the book, the application even crashes and exits itself and finally the book can't be read, only small books can be opened and read, even though my internet connection is very good."
Unable to fetch data from server...and no dls
"Are there no books about early childhood here? For piaud courses?? Please increase the number of books."""
Cool app
"Sorry, may I know how to download this application on a laptop correctly?"
nice
"It's an application for reading books, although it's not complete, but there's also a lot of ""exciting"" reading."
"Worst app I've ever seen. Always crashes. When I want to read the screen is all white. Uninstall again and enter the password can't work. Reset password can't either. Oh, it's annoying. Isn't there a child of this nation who can make good applications?"
"It's a shame that this application can't make a laptop, if it can be repaired, it's already great"
"Previously, I used to open and borrow and read books from Ipusnas, when I got here it was difficult to enter and it became complicated..."
"Is there a problem or what? I borrowed a book that was already downloaded. When I open it on the bookshelf, the book can't be opened. Only selectable downloads. But when downloaded it still doesn't work. In vain I borrow a book but it can't be read. Let alone read, just can't open it. Ô∏è"
cool
"A very useful application, for developers maybe the appearance can be improved, the spy is more comfortable to read and makes the eyes comfortable with a more modern appearance."
"The application is good, but often down. Borrowed books if they don't fit can't be returned right away, you have to wait 1 day. Please, fix the bugs. Books cannot be borrowed. An example of a book that cannot be borrowed from the encyclopedia of science by the nuasa team. Everything can't be borrowed. But other books can be borrowed."
"It has been very helpful in carrying out the task. It's just that every time you find the book you're looking for, it's always out of stock. Please increase the stock of books that are in great demand so that the queue is not too long."
Suggestion: if you can add a table of contents to make it easier to know the contents before downloading
"The supply in this application is very low, when I have found the book I was looking for but the stock is out So it is recommended to stock more books for each title Because during the pandemic I can only read books from my cellphone Thank you"
Upgrade
good
"This iPunas really helped me a lot in finding reference books for lecture assignments, but unfortunately it was not complete, especially for the types of books that are often used. My advice, please increase the number of books and hopefully add a text search feature so that you can find the words you want to search for in the book more quickly."
The book is not complete
"How do I borrow it, I've typed in an email, but it still doesn't work, in the end I can't borrow a book, what should I do?üòê"
"The books are not very complete, I don't have my matkul book"
The book cannot be downloaded.
Thank you ipusnas
Need more collection
I ask you to please complete more books on law for students.
Very helpful in the learning process and also interest in reading
"I like the books on ipusnas but am disappointed because they are incomplete, then the book that I have downloaded is not there, there is only 1 book on the shelf to be read, then when I want to enter I always can't because I can't retrieve data on the server, no there is DLS even though the network is good, and it has also been updated, please fix the application so I can't access it, thank you in advance"
"I've downloaded it but the application can't even be opened, the only thing that exists is that it can't retrieve data from the server and dls. Even though I really need it"
Sometimes the app is very difficult to use.
why can't it be opened
"No DLS what does that mean? I don't understand, so how do I solve this?"
"Very helpful in learning, especially during a pandemic like this, the books are complete here.. Thank you"
Why can't the national library application be used?? What is this?? Why can't it be opened again today???
Difficult login
"Unusable, No data or DLS. Application stopped!"
It took a long time to log in and ended up not being able to log in
"No DLS, what does that mean?"
"Updated: I changed 5 stars for the latest ipusnas application.. siipp, keep the good work.. Below is my old review: ---------------------- ------------------ The old review was 2 stars, now it's just changing to 1 star. Look for the old book to load, when the result is there, it can't be opened, let alone downloaded. iPusnas, why is the application just getting worse? Even though in the beginning it was my favorite, you know, at that time I gave 5 stars.."
"The book has been successfully borrowed but can't be opened to read, Ipusnas writing has stopped"
Very helpful..
Add Book Collection
Excellent
Just stop
great
"Sorry, Sis, why can't I login when I log in? It always says allow permission, after I click ok. Straight out"
"The book you are looking for is not in the search field, whereas I've been able to find it before. Already found a good book in the search field"
Help
nice
Thank you I am happy with this application
"I can't register, because of server maintenance"
Jose
"First experience was a bit annoyed, sorry. Cannot enter specific targeted keywords. Always lead to similar words with 1-2 letter differences. For example: laxman, the result is even the ocean. Debons, the result is even a demon. Etc. That's all my criticism. Update on criticism: the book was found but empty. Book goal: introduction to archives: from policy issues to management~muhammad rosyihan hendrawan, UB press Update 2.0: only good for general books. Not recommended for lecture textbooks"
Hopefully this application can be upgraded and can load more complete books
"Very satisfied and really like this application. It has helped a lot on several occasions and fulfilled the hobby of reading books. A little suggestion, maybe a feature like a wishlist could be presented so that users can choose the books they want to read later, because the queue feature can only be used when the book stock is out of borrowed. Features such as wishlists can make it easier for users to make a list of books they want to read, then they can choose which books they want to borrow and read first. Thank you üôè"
"Although not very complete, but it was enough to help me find some popular books. As input, it may be possible to update the reading display to make it more comfortable and easy to use."
"This application is very good, especially at this time when it really needs online references, in the future hopefully the layout will be updated again to make it fresher and easier for the future, plus the availability of reference books so you don't have to look for references from other sources that are lacking. reliable, thank you"
Really like
"The application needs to be improved because it is very difficult to apply and there are many problems in its use, the quality of the application can be improved so that it is comfortable to use."
"I've been using ipusnas for 2 years... helping me, when I'm busy, I can't go to the local library and rarely even buy books. But just when I borrowed a book, why was the book so difficult to download so I couldn't read it even though it was in the borrowed category. Even though yesterday afternoon it was still possible :("
"I want to make a loan but I can't, it says the email hasn't been verified and told me to see the incoming contact but it's not there I've refreshed many times even though there is still no incoming contact"
"The book collection is not complete, every time I look for the book, it's not there"
"Error, why every 5 minutes always force close for the application. This is very uncomfortable to read please fix it soon"
Wapik
best!
"very useful. advice please do not minimize borrowing books, there is no limit when borrowing books in a day."
How do I borrow a book at Ipusnas?
The ebook should be reproduced..
The search is fine. Keep improving ipusnas. Awaited collection of other books.
"what you are looking for, what appears, it's not complete"
"FOR THE ADMIN TEAM For books from the TEMPO DATA AND ANALYSIS CENTER, PLEASE INCLUDE THE YEAR OF THE BOOK IS PUBLISHED, because yesterday I read articles from 2005 and below and they are not relevant for this year. PLEASE CONSIDER AGAIN In addition, the UI display is beautified so that readers feel more comfortable, THANK YOU"
"Assalamualaikum, this Ipusnas application is very good, it is useful to increase knowledge. My advice is to increase the borrowing of the book to 10 books a day, then the borrowing period of the book is 7 days so I can finish reading it, thank you Ipusnas üòäüòäüòä"
"It's trying to log in. It's very difficult, since now it's impossible"
"It's good, but it's better if there is one for PC because reading on the cellphone the writing is very small"
"Very happy with the existence of this online library from the National Library, I can read as much books as I like. I hope that fiction readings (popular categories and or best sellers) as well as non-fiction related to school/college lessons will be added üòä"
"I can't borrow because I have to verify my email, but when I check my email there isn't a single message for verification... I'm confused about how... It's just a lie if there's no verification message..."
"1. Bookmarks can't be used, please fix it. 2. The collection of translated books is better added :) 3. The table of contents in some books is not working"
"The application often crashes, please develop the app again. Even though the network is also good"
"Super duper good application, I like to read ""small and small have works (KKPK)"" in this application, the application is really good, thank you for making this, so if I want to read the KKPK book, I don't need to buy the book :)"
"Just downloaded but the application cannot be opened ""an error occurred, did not retrieve data from the server"" why huh?????"
"Very helpful, but there are some books that are not in this application."
The book collection is good. Only a more complete physical version at the Surabaya city library. Hopefully it can be improved. The app often bugs. Even though my cellphone is always smooth for large versions of the app. The tools and facilities are incomplete. Please develop. The keywords often don't filter properly. What a shame. This very useful app is getting less attention
Why can't it be opened?
"How come I can't enter the app, can't retrieve data from the server and there's no dls?"
Why is it that when I want to open the apk there is no data and DLS?
"In my application, the error is still there :("
Like error.
"Very good and useful and greatly increase interest in reading. A little input... Added more books, there are still many books that are not in this Ipusnas.. And considering the loan period... At least give us 1 week (7 days) to borrow 1 book. Enthusiasm for the management team iPusnas. Applications that are very useful for the nation"
"The application is good, but there are still frequent bugs, please fix it soon"
ok
"It's good, but please add more to the book collection to make it more complete."
Good and helpful But the title that you are looking for is not available. Let's add another title. About the economy
"Sorry admin, I want to ask, why when I open Ipusnas I can't screenshot the contents, right???"
"Sis, I want to borrow a book, how come I can't, even when I want to borrow a book, it fails and it says ""Failed. You don't have a hold item yet."" What do you mean?"
"Respect for the application maker, very helpful, hopefully in the future there will be more national and international books available, the application will be better and make it easier for readers"
"It's hard to borrow the book #edit thanks min now it's not enough, just a suggestion, hopefully there will be more copies of the book"
Bgs
"Thank you, yes, you can do it"
Very nice
"Very useful apps, unfortunately the books are not complete, especially the legal science books, there are very few variations and also none of the books are used as references on campus so you have to buy books :("
"Highly recommended for students / students. It's just that if you can make more copies of the collection, also add a lot of books, then give the option to search for words so you can find them quickly so that it doesn't take time if you need it fast"
"Good for reference, just need more books"
Very helpful
"It's very comfortable with this application, making it easier to find references, but why do you suddenly ask to login with email or Facebook. But when I log in, it keeps on not connecting. So I can't borrow another book. How about this, I also entered the wrong email even though it was correct"
"This application is experiencing problems or what? When I wanted to download a book it suddenly came out by itself and suddenly got an error. Please fix it again, thank you"
"Sorry in advance, dear admin, I have a problem when I want to register my account either through my Facebook account or the verification email, that's really lame. I wonder why?"
"The application cannot be opened, is there another way to open the application"
crazy bugs. when do i read it
Wokeh benefits
"I didn't get an email for verification, so I can't borrow books"
Bad
Why can't I log in... Even though my internet is good
Thank God the application is very useful at times like this.
"Why can't the borrowed book be opened? Always appears the words ""iPusnas stopped"". Please help admin."
"Why can't I open the search page, and it's difficult to borrow the book. please help"
"The center is free books. Unfortunately, you often have to log in first. Sometimes you can't open the ones you borrowed"
Why is it that the book I'm looking for in the app doesn't appear? Even though when I searched on Google the details of the book were on Ipusnas but after looking in the APK it wasn't there.
"Please, make more copies, I've been waiting in line for a long time, I never got the book, please from Ipusnas, please read it"
MasyaAllah tabarakallah I like the iPusnas app
iPusnas is solid...
Very nice
Why does the server often crash? So you can't borrow books
Well
The app is really good. Lots of good translations.
"Good, I've borrowed the book üëç"
Hi assalamualaikum min. I want to reset my password because I forgot the password but why is the link to update the password that the admin has sent to my email instead the link is wrong. I've tried several times but still the same min. Error link
"Brother, why is it that now when we borrow a book, we can't open it, it's so bad, last year we still could! Seriously asking, it's hard for me to do my homework."
Why is it that every time I want to read the novel I can't.. And it comes out of the apk itself.. (Please answer immediately)
"The server is currently undergoing maintenance, which is very annoying. I can't borrow books. Even though I've been through a long queue. In addition, the appearance of the book that does not have page numbers from the beginning to the end, aka only per chapter, is quite annoying because I can't write down the pages I like. I have to calculate it from the start. Then, the search system is also difficult and the related search is not precise. Less than one word has deviated his search."
"If you add a book to your wish list/borrow a book, what's the return system?"
Older brother. Why can't I see the picture of the book and I can't borrow it?
"Wow, this apk is very good so far I have never had a problem, hopefully it can be better."
"It's the same, there's no change, I've logged in but I can't, once using another apk other than this, it can mean that my network is stable, if the problem is the network, it's impossible, my org can login in another apk."
"Why has the reading view of all books on Ipusnas changed, so I can't give bookmarks, and I can no longer change the display to swipe right like before, so please change the reading view of Ipusnas to the way it used to be because now it's actually making it difficult for readers to scroll down because I can't remember where I read it, and that made me very uncomfortable."
It's good too but sometimes like error
"I give 1 star because it can't be screenshotted even though it makes it easier for us to quote references. In addition, books can only be returned 1x24 hours even though certain books between titles and contents are irrelevant. For example, the book on General Elections compiled by Fathmi does not contain a descriptive description and that means the book does not suit the needs of the reader but cannot be returned because it must meet the minimum time limit."
"Please pay attention again, such as the collection of books added and also a copy of the book"
"This app is very helpful. But my advice, hopefully it will be fixed again. Because lately the application is often slow and does not display search results. That is all and thank you. #senior High School student"
now the book....many of them don't have a copy...üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Why can't I open the book?
I hope that new interesting books will continue to be added and the system with frequent errors will be fixed again
"The book is not complete like the author Felix Y Siauw is not there, are you trying to cover knowledge?"
Incomplete
nice
The beginning of use is still good but after a few weeks the application often crashes
Borrowing time is too short and allocation is not ideal for readers. Hopefully iPusnas can improve in serving the needs of the community and be even better in the future. Thank you
Good
Excellent
Amazing!!!
Why do I have to log in when I want to read detective stories
"Please give 5 stars, let's support this program for reading progress."
Please add bookmark feature
why can't it be opened? The writes can't fetch data from the server and there's no DLS. What do you mean?
"I like it, there is a digital library like this. I hope the book collection will be added, especially related to library science hehe.."
"Hello iPusnas. Thank you for this free book borrowing application. But I want to ask, is there still a setting that changes the page layout to resemble a book page. I searched but did not find. I really like that setting, but I can't find it now. Please answer yes, iPusnas. I am very comfortable with the layout that resembles a book. Thank you Ô∏è"
"Very good, the books are quite complete, you must download it so that Indonesians like to read wherever and whenever, even though there is no book"
"Why the first connection error anyway? The search also doesn't come out the book, even though yesterday there was one."
"I'm sorry why the search results don't match so many books can't be found.. I see in the reading history, the books are still there & can be borrowed. Meanwhile, when you search in the search column, it doesn't exist.. Maybe this is the reason why many say the book is missing, even though it's still there, it just doesn't appear in the search results, so I can't find it. Thank you very much"
Increase your knowledge and interest in reading with various and quality readings.
Please add a favorite addition feature so that the book you want to borrow can be stored in the favorites list
"Why can't my e-mail register? When you want to borrow a book, you can't even continue... what's the solution? Please help"
"Very helpful. Suggestions, bookmarks can direct to the page in question."
"EDIT: As of 07/09/2020, the search feature is back to normal again. Thanks admin! /********************************************/ After the update there seems to be a bug on the search feature. The problem is that there are many book titles that can't be found when you search through the search."
"Overall is good, there are many good books and novels in this apk. But lately it's been taking a long time to load during the search process."
Is it an error again? I can't reset my passwordüò¢
"Hopefully with this application, it can foster a love of reading for people in Indonesia"
"The search feature is problematic. The books shown do not match. In fact, some are not found. Whereas previously I had found the book I was looking for. Please fix it, I have been using this apk for a long time.."
"I like the book menu, which can be added to the basket, so it's easy to open it :))"
So far the ipusnas application has really helped me in fulfilling my reading needs. Especially during a pandemic that requires many things to be accessed in digital form. Although there are some system errors when I want to reset a forgotten account password.
"Sis, please fix the search feature. Because error..."
"Searching for books is a bit problematic, because the keywords you typed in are not relevant"
Applications still often error.
"why is it that in the search feature very few results come out even though in the book category feature there are very many available. for example when I search with the keyword ""history"". only about 10 books appeared and many were irrelevant. please solve"
Why can't all the search words be sorted? The search for the author's name or title was not found even though it was there before in the borrowing history.
"Admin, please~ fix the SEARCH section of the book.. when I search by author's name & title ""SEARCH PAGE NOT FOUND"" And I've updated the application, but it's still an error. -_-|| thx"
"Ipusnas is very helpful in reducing pirated books, but it seems that the existing book collections are not being added but actually decreasing. I can't find books that I used to have and haven't had the chance to borrow."
Very helpful. Please add to the collection of books. Thank you
This app is very helpful
"Very good and very useful. But sometimes if you want to find a book, you can't find it. Even though you have typed the title of the book or the author's name, and what comes out is the title of another book. Even though the book I was looking for was in iPusnas."
"Why do the search results not match the book you want to search for? I wrote Tere Liye's book and another one appeared. Please fix the bug, okay?"
"Very good. But why the search results do not match the keywords? Is the system wrong or what, please fix it. So I can't find the book I want to read. The search is in vain."
"Many books disappeared from ipusnas. At first I knew that Ika Natasha's books were missing, but I was still relaxed. Another check today, and all of Agatha Christie's novels have disappeared without a trace. Sad. What's wrong with Ipusnas?"
"there is a problem with the search field, please fix it"
"the book title search field is problematic, please fix it"
"For the ""search"" feature, please fix it again, because when I searched for the book that I had borrowed it couldn't be found, I finally went to the borrowing history feature. Thank you"
"Sorry, how come the searching feature doesn't seem to be working properly? Is this app currently under maintenance?"
good
What's the matter with the application? How come all book searches have problems? Please fix the search system üôè
"Why is it that many of the books I'm looking for don't appear, instead, others appear?"
Cultivate and empower domestically made
"The application is good, the book collection is quite complete and easy to use. Very helpful, especially during a pandemic like now. Response to errors is also quite fast."
Is every Saturday and Sunday the national library is closed in Jakarta so that the online library can't be opened either? Please confirm it. Thank you
"The application is very good and helpful, but it seems that I often experience bugs so that when I search for books that are actually on ipusnas, I find the word ""Oops.. ""."
Can not be opened
"Always error, why yes. kmren I have to register again. Now I can't access the book anymore. What's the maintance again?"
"At the beginning, I was a little confused on how to use it, but now, I can start to reproduce the ebook collection, thank you"
"How come it can't be opened today, even though the signal is good... Yesterday it was still open..."
"What happened to ipusnas, why did many of its book collections suddenly disappear? What is this?"
"I don't like the UI design, please improve the appearance so that it looks pleasing to the eye, I'm sure the government will be able to hire UI designers, thank you"
It's good thank you ipusnas development team Ô∏èü§óüòò
How come there are so many Harlequin novels that I can't find anymore?
Why is the book collection even less?
"A good app, the book collection is quite complete. But now how come it can't be accessed? I've been trying to find author Dan Brown, but it's not there, even though there used to be..., I've tried to find another author whose books I've borrowed/read, but suddenly they're gone. Why, what's the problem with the app?"
"The search feature is really stupid. For example, I searched for Okky Madasari's book in the search column, but it didn't come out. The ones that came out were books that were not relevant to the keyword ""Okky Madasari"" that I wrote, even though I knew that Okky Madasari's book was still available at Ipusnas. Please the Ipusnas IT officer to fix it immediately."
"Really like this application. Quite helpful. It's just that when I look for the title of the book I'm looking for, why isn't it there? Even though it was there before. When I tried to use the author's name, it still wasn't there, instead the books that didn't match what I was looking for appeared. Tried with several other titles, which I had read before, and the results were the same, none/not appropriate. It was never like this before."
"Are you bugging? The search feature is not optimal, aka can't search for books by author's name :("
"What are you looking for, what comes out? Is this the really bad apk or is there a bug?"
WL. Find cool books through this app^^
Kereeen
"Please, I want to read Lockwood & Co. But when I searched it wasn't there :) even though when I first installed it I looked for it, please don't filter it too much, I'm having a hard time finding it, looking for fairy tales that I like tooüôèüôè"
"Why can't I verify my email, so I can't borrow books. The book I'm looking for doesn't appear in the search results either"
"Sorry I have to reduce the rating given, I can't find the book I need in the search field. There is a bug in the Ipusnas application that causes the search results to differ from the search keywords I entered regarding the identification of the book (title, subtitle, or author's name). It is hoped that Ipusnas will immediately fix this bug for the convenience of service users. Keep working Ipusnas! üëç"
"With this application, it is no longer difficult for me to be able to read books. But as input, the interface display a.k.a. The UI on the home is quite troublesome because there are only two books per line, so you have to scroll a lot to browse books. The search box is also often inaccurate, so it's a good idea to create an option so you can search by title, author, publisher, or genre. And also when full screen in the book, often when sliding the screen suddenly the menu appears again."
"On my cellphone, redmi note 8, apk no force closes every time I want to read a book on the bookshelf."
Applications that are easy to use and very helpful for those of us who like to read.
Old verification please fix
"Ipusnas has a lot of benefits, thank you to the team who came up with this brilliant ideaüíô‚ò∫üòç"
Must use id. Cards. Formerly :(
It's incomplete when there isn't a Doraemon comic or a canon detective
Hopefully. Growing up
"Very useful, I have maintained this application for more than 2 years on my cellphone."
Not good
"Dog shit application.. why can't login even though the password for the cellphone number and email is correct but still can't log in, just taking care of the application is not good enough for this country"
"If you can copy a few more books, so the queue won't take long"
"The application is really good, but please, please add more copies of novels that are really busy, like Tereliye's Bumi and its sequels, from the middle school window, the land of bastards has Tereliye, etc. The queue is lol, it's really awesome, at that time there was still a copy of 1 and I wanted to borrow it, uh I couldn't, I lost so fast... Iihhhh it's really gemessss"
why the ipusnas app can't be opened
"Why can't it be opened, wow"
Verification doesn't appear in the email
"Pretty good, for there are a few obstacles that make me angry. Please fix it again like when you want to borrow but get an error or come out on your own. The rest is the best"
"Cool, but if I may suggest the borrowing time is increased. And can be marked when we last read. Because if you haven't read it, when you open it, you have to find out where it's read"
Very useful
"This application is very helpful for me who likes to read books and reduce illegal book piracy. A little advice from me so that the collection of books and copies are added, also add the full mode feature so that readers like this application more, thank youüíï"
"Good, please provide the strikethrough feature, so that we can underline the i, like in the pdf, you know.. Hehe,, the admin is like a tmpt to save the explanation of words that we don't know what they mean. Example :-Love: ""Expression of love to someone""üòÇ.. Thank you admin"
Please add Tere Liye's novels please
"Why can't it be opened? Every time I try to enter, I fail..."
"It can be used, thanks, the suggestion is to have a night mode so it doesn't get hot in the eyes at night hehe"
"If you like reading books, I suggest you download this apk ."
"The application is good, but still confused about how to use it? Especially looking for the book we want, is there no search button?"
Very goodüòÄ
Rubbish
Application full of bugs
Very useful for the people. Greetings literacy
"I am happy that Ipusnas can read anytime and anywhere, and when there is a new Epusnas why can't I join because I have to enter my password to login using Facebook, what can I do to follow Epusnas?"
"At the beginning of installing the application, it was very satisfying and highly recommended for reference assignments, unfortunately, when the desired book was updated, many lost/no longer existed. Please care for students üòä"
God bless you..
Useful to increase knowledge and improve literacy culture
"The application is very good, please improve"
"Sorry, why can't I open it, it says the data server can't"
Please make an automatic book page search
"Why is the app getting worse hereüò≠ even though I've been using this ipusnas for a long time and it wasn't like this before...since yesterday I wanted to download the book, I couldn't even though my signal was also good...please fix it again"
"I can't open it, even though it used to work fine. Hmmm"
"It is very helpful to use the time to open up your horizons by reading books, but the borrowing time is not that long. Suggestions for a week or so, let the readers have more time for books that have a lot of pages. Thank you"
My verification code hasn't been creamed yet
I really like this app. but as a suggestion.. can you add more existing book references.. and also maybe borrowing books a day can be more and more flexible.. If the application is of high quality then of course consumers and readers download and are satisfied. Thank you
"Very helpful app in doing assignments. Input, 1) If possible, the loan period is extended to a week or 10 days. After the loan limit is completed, it is automatically returned. 2) For the books, please complete them immediately, because apparently there are still many books that I was looking for, which are not available. Thank you"
In the application can not borrow books
"I really enjoy using this application, now if you want to talk about it, just search here and you don't need to googling anymore, it's increasing the application of knowledge, but please increase the collection of books, okay?"
It's really good to read foam without going to the library
"Application is good. But why is it that when I download it, when I open the book it always comes back by itself.. Please condition it first"
"Till today I can't access any book. My socializer position suddenly turned into a bookworm. Hmmm, if I keep getting this error, I'd better delete it."
"Sorry, before 1 month ago I opened this application and it was fine, but after I downloaded it again I opened the application and it said ""unable to retrieve data from server and no DLS, close the application?"" I click try again but it doesn't work. How can I do that?"
"It's getting more and more unreachable by the day. I thought it was a problem with my internet data, but it turned out to be the app that couldn't be accessed. Please fix it soonüôè"
"Arrived ""the application can't be opened :("
Just going to try
Adding insight.
"The collection of books is quite large, but because it's free, you can't expect more... But it's good, at least we can read first, choose the good ones and then buy the physical books. This is very helpful to avoid choosing the wrong book. August, 2020."
"iPusnas application, good for finding books/literacy that are liked in the world of education, technology, etc. iPusnas is smart to use, easy to download, sophisticated, friendly and safe."
Literacy that helps education
"After the update makes emotions. The book has been downloaded when I clicked on it, eh... In fact, the apk has been forced to close repeatedly. How come when you need it, it's like this, I just want to say it's dirty. Auto uninstall and blacklist."
nice
Why can't register? And it's really hard to log in too
"Thank you, I think my cellphone is the problem üòä"
Thank you for the response now it's getting better
Why can't it be opened???
"Good, why do you often get errors? Can't enter the app"
Why won't this come in? What to do?
Can't open the app
"Already downloaded, can't open"
Why can't it be opened?
"Good morning, I want to ask about my problem logging in to the Ipusnas application, namely the warning ""cannot retrieve data from server, no DLS, close the application?"" What do you think is the cause?"
"I want to give a lot of stars because it's really that good, but that was before the fire nation attacked and now Ipusnas is inaccessible. I tried to uninstall and then install again but still can't open, what appears instead is ""unable to retrieve data from server and no DLS, close the application?"". Even though I really need a reference book huhufufu"
Is this maintenance or what? It's so weird it can't be opened
"How come this game has been downloaded, how come I can't open the apk, even though I've already googled the member list"
"The app is good, it's just a shame that one day there is a book loan limit. Then after five days the loan is automatically deleted. Unfortunately, you can only borrow up to 65 books, right? Once I borrowed 65 books, I couldn't borrow anything else. The notification is that you have reached the loan limit. Sad"
"Why can't it be used? Every time I want to borrow, the error continues. Uninstall it. Disappointed‚òπÔ∏è"
"the book is good. Famous books such as Sophie's world, to kill a mockingbird, etc. also exist. It used to be a bug, but now it doesn't seem like it."
"Can't login because I forgot the password but the account can't be returned When pressing the forget password button appears ""network timeout"" Please fix (Edit) Thank you for being able"
",üò¥"
"Why can't this apk be opened on my cellphone, please explain, thank you"
The book is good....it's useful
"A very helpful and useful application to add reading material. It's just that the book collections need to be expanded because there are still some books that are not yet available here. In addition, there are also some books whose bookmarks don't work. Hopefully in the future Ipusnas will be better. Thank you"
"How is it possible to educate the nation's life, the ipusnas apk often has errors"
"I have been a member for almost 1 year. About 2 months ago I did not open the application. When I re-opened the application, suddenly I had to register again to become a member and it wasn't just once, but up to 3√ó, then I couldn't download/borrow the book either. It's a pity, during a pandemic like this, it even makes an error"
Am I the only one who feels the book here is incomplete?
Very useful. Please increase the collection of his books on historical documentation
"It's when I want to register, why is it taking so long: ""Even though the signal is good. Waited for a long time but still can't get in. Why is that the problem, isn't it?"
"Please make more books, especially the best sellers.. but its really really helpful, thanks"
"I can't download this application even though my package is still 12gb, and my cellphone just cooked my cellphone wrong, I waited for 2 hours"
Good slurd
"Sorry, I can't log in, how do I do this?"
"That's right again. Even though I really hope for this app. From the start, it's okay"
"Please add more health books, to add references for health students such as medicine and nursing. Thank you"
"The book is not complete, hopefully it will be more complete in the future. Amen. Complaints: Why does my National Library of Indonesia borrow a book every time, the book won't open, right? Every time you want to read, you even exit the application"
The admin response is amazing
"Good, complete and easy"
"Assalamualaikum Sorry for the developer, how do you choose that category?? After I click back and forth, I can't, thank you, wassalam mualaikum"
"Books written by Sheikh Muhammad bin Salih Al Utsaimin, how come there aren't any..."
Maybe you can add a reading mode to the background
This app is really good
Beneficial
It's great to be able to borrow and read books with various titles
Difficult to log in
Excellent
Hopefully the National Library of Indonesia will be better in the future
Helpful but often lags and errors. That's annoying.
"How come you can't borrow a book, right??"
"How come I can't open it, please fix it"
Suitable for those who are looking for free
Why is it getting an error after so long :(
"Install the anti screenshot feature on admin... Nb. If the old version of the apk is installed, it can still run normally. And it can still be screenshot. Come on, it's patched again, min. Force update to new app"
"How about this, yesterday can be read, downloaded. Eh, now you have to download it again, that's how the download keeps failing. I'm already doing 80% of the time I want to do it again, the time is running out. How about it, my score is at stake for this app"
Why has it been almost 1 month the app can't read books? Get out on your own. I'm using qiomi 4x
Very supportive of free reading applications for Indonesian people who like to read but missqueen budget
Likes an error when opening a borrowed book
Long download
Thank God it's good. Read for free. Please more books
"I really like reading books. Every day read a book. But because there is Corona, so just read through this"
"I feel that this app often has errors, even though I really like reading books from here. Hopefully the system can be improved again."
"Like it, very helpful and lots of interesting books too."
It would be even better if there was a discussion forum for book lovers
"Hello bro, develop... so the application is okay, it's just that it looks boring and tends to make you sleepy. For those who are new to this app, you must be a bit confused about the search field, and options such as dark backgrounds, page transitions. Oh yes, on the homepage it often happens when scrolling and want to click on the title of the book, eh, it's actually refreshed...!!. Isn't it fun to develop.... *note: please add the number of pages in the description section...,"
"At first, I praised, wow, there is now a cool book borrowing application, but how come I open it for the second or third time but it can't even open, it's a shame I'm so disappointed, please fix it in the future, ok"
"Sorry in advance, lately the application is difficult to log in... Hopefully it can be better."
ok
It's not clear
Why not open? I was disappointed
"Yesterday I gave 1 star because the application could not be opened at all. Now it can be opened. Unfortunately, the book I was looking for was not there. Even though it is in the library. I hope that in the future there will be more literacy books for research bases. Thank you for the hard work of the development team. Good luck for the future"
The best
"admin, my email has not been verified, please how do I do it? confused"
"""Unable to fetch data from server and no DLS."" More or less the writing is like that, every time I open the application. Guess why?"
"Bro, please make the reading screen anti-radiation so that the eyes that read it don't get damaged. How do you want to increase people's reading power, try if the price of the book is expensive, then there are free ones, the risk is permanent eye damage Ô∏è. Please take care of this, bro. thx."
"My email verification hasn't been sent, I've been waiting for a long time"
"Very good üëç But just a suggestion, the iPusnas application should add a Category feature, also so that the book search feature can be further improved, to make it easier to find books at iPusnas. It is also hoped that the collection of books can be added, especially foreign reference books which seem to be few available at iPusnas - especially when compared to, for example, the iBI Library owned by Bank Indonesia. Hopefully this suggestion can be considered üôèüèæ"
"Hi, is ipunas still under maintenance?"
"It's already 5 stars. One question I have is, when queuing for borrowing books and books are available, why isn't there a notification on the screen?"
Cool
"I hope you always improve yourself for the sake of educating the nation's children. If the nation is smart, we are lucky too"
"Why is this, every time I want to enter it says an error ""Unable to retrieve data from server and no DLS, close the application?"" When it comes out, how do you do it? Even though previously this application was fine, it has been re-installed and it's still the same"
"There is no improvement in the application? No updates? Even though I've been waiting for an update from this app for a long time üòÇ, I hope there's a newer, cooler feature."
"This application is really good, but please make the book so that it can still be opened even though it is offline because in remote areas there is rarely a signal, so if you open this application there must be a good internet signal and quota. If it could be downloaded then it could be read offline it would be better."
steady
This is the app I've been looking for..
Application cannot be opened. I will add a star when this application can be opened.
"A very good and useful application for the intelligence of the nation's children. To the developers, please add a collection of books about electrical engineering. Thank you üòä"
How come this can't be borrowed... Always network time out even though I open other online features smoothly... Please explain and solve
"Thank you the application is very helpful. But I'm having trouble opening the app this morning. I don't know why the application can't be opened, until I reinstall it it still can't be opened. Please help, thank you."
Fix the application first.. Can't connect server..
"I've downloaded it but when I open it, I can't load data, how is this application?"
Why can't I open the app? Can't retrieve data from server and no DLS what is it?
There are so many new books that I can use as a reference for my scientific work.
How come I never get a notification? :(((but I'll fix it later
Good... How come it's hard to log in... do you think it's okay too?
"The notification is better if it appears outside the application, it's like a gt fb notification, if it's only inside the application, we don't know if we don't open the apk, so we lose quickly to the one who always waits in line"
"I waited for the login for a very long time, from 1 hour ago until now it still can't, and I have to wait a very long time, if it continues like this, I'll just uninstall it, please fix it"
"Hello... I usually after I click borrow a book, I can directly download and read it... but today why can't it be downloaded? always says ""file not found"". why is this?"
"Sis, why has it been borrowed but can't be downloaded? It's been re-installed also can't"
"Danjuk, the concept is good but the application is rotten. For the PC version, is there an update, when it's downloaded, every time it comes out, you want to read it again, you have to download it over and over again. I don't intend to make an application, big budget but half intention"". As*"
"Actually this application is good since I started using it smoothly and helps to add insight, but after updating why can't I read the book I downloaded, tried to reopen the book but it always exits the application by itself, please fix the application üôè"
"A very good application especially for those who like to read. But from a few days ago when I wanted to borrow it when it was downloaded I couldn't. But the network is good. Please fix it, thank you."
"How come the application can't be opened at all, even though the data package is also running smoothly."
"I really like this application, Alhamdulillah now being able to read free books can increase my knowledge even though the money is mediocre but it's a shame that many don't know this application, people's interest in reading is still low"
"How...how...?, login must use fb, can't use a google accountüëâüòïüëà"
I'm disappointedüò≠üò≠
"I like it, but how come a new novel like Mariposa has not been found, please fix it"
"Alhamdulillah, there are many collections of books, hopefully new books will be available"
Thank you for creating this application. So I can read books that I can't afford :)
"Ipusnas, a very good and useful application. Thanks to the ipusnas application developers. Through this application I can borrow books and read them wherever I am. The books available also helped me in completing the task. Especially in the midst of a pandemic like now, Ipusnas really helps in borrowing books from home"
"Very helpful and interesting in increasing knowledge without having to come directly to the library, the collection is quite complete. It's just that the loan period should be extended again for up to a week. Thank you."
How is this.. I just downloaded the apk.. how come I can't login at all.. it keeps loading
Please add ring notification feature for book queue. It's really difficult to have to open Ipusnas often to check
Very nice
"Great, no errors"
"it's good but how come I want to enter, why can't I"
It's hard to read the book. Click borrow can't be opened
"I'm sorry sis ... want to give five stars ... sorry I logged in several times ... via personal fb failed ... please hurry sis ... during this pandemic.,,, good luck kk,,, education system require baxa at home"
you have to download it first
"The collection is large and free to borrow, but every time you want to read a book that has been borrowed, the application will close automatically. So I can only look at the title of the book."
Thankyou
"It's great to have apps like this, I hope the UI UX can be better"
This app is very useful and easy to use. Hopefully it continues to grow and bring a positive influence.
Assalamualaikum.. this is why I can't login using email even though the email and password are correct. But why always fail. It takes too long to login using Facebook. Please wait.. even though the network is good..
thank you iPusnas! hopefully the reading collection will increase üôè
Help
"thank you, the application is very helpful. But lately, it often fails/errors when borrowing books"
The application is indeed very useful to increase interest in reading in Indonesia. But you can't add a wishlist feature to make it easier to find books you want to read but don't have time. thanks
Wow... why can't ipusnas be installed today? So upset without Ipusnas. Please... Please fix it! Thank you...
"Hi sis, how come the login takes so long, huh?"
Can't login. I have filled out the membership form on google as well. Still can't
It's normal okay
ok ok
"Why am I having a hard time logging in? Already using Facebook, Eh, where did it run, using email, it says the password doesn't match."
"Why does the apk always have an error ""unable to retrieve data from server and no Ols"" it's always like that.. Even though this apk is very helpful in completing thesis :'( please how is this"
"The cache has been deleted, other applications don't work, the signal is full bar but it's still often forced closed"
Thank you very much iPusnas...The best is reallyüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
"I am satisfied with the Ipusnas service. However... I'm sorry, since the third week of July 2020, I can't borrow books from Ipusnas. The size of the file to download, the availability of the book and the description do not appear. Please, fix it. I really need this app"
"Recommended for those whose homes are far from the library, the collection is also quite complete"
"How to read books Practically anywhere, advice is to increase the collection of books. Especially for elementary school textbooks, and also general books on skills. Thank you"
Slow... can't be opened
Excellent..
"It's a good application. But why suddenly when you want to enter it says it can't retrieve data and there's no DLS, right? Pls tell me why is that??"
"The application is not flexible. Likewise, the collection is only ""seuprit"" as a national library. Hadeeh."
Assalamualaikum sir. Why can't I login?
Why does every time I open the application and open the book the application stops? Even though it's really important for thesis Even though usually the apk doesn't stop like that.? Please fix it soon...
"Why is the app weird? Why is it that when logging in using Facebook it doesn't finish? Up to half an hour. Even though the signal supports. Don't just apologize when you see complaints in reviews, fix them. I thought the quality was good but it was really bad. For others, you will regret it if you download this application."
Are you still repairing?
"This is why every time I access the application, it always appears ""unable to retrieve data from server and no DLS"" I tried it on another cellphone too"
Sorry iPusnas. Performance is enough. But keep improving. Because sometimes there is a *network timeout* problem. But sometimes it's fine on its own. Please upgrade soon.
"Why is Ipusnas difficult to access now? Just open the application, it says can't retrieve data from server. Please help"
"I just downloaded the application and can't even open it, why is this?"
"Sometimes, how come you snap and snap, yes, the application"
"I'm a new user and tried to open it, but the application can't be opened at all, even though I use home wifi whose signal can be said to be stable, please fix it again, in order to improve services so that people's interest in reading is boosted again. Greetings Literature!"
"Sis I've logged in but how come it's out by itself. I haven't verified my email, how come it's still hard to enter. Kaka Admin also no longer email, you know. Policy please, Sis, because I actually like this application, it can make lesson references, but how come it's getting an error now?"
"I just downloaded the apk, but how come the error keeps happening when I want to open the application. I can't open the app :("
Why every time I open I can't connect to the server and no DLS?
already installed but can't open
"It's quite helpful, it's just that lately it's been getting errors often, why is that?"
Very useful appüëç
"Why sometimes the app can't be used, right? Also, sometimes the book can't be read, it's like the book itself is lost from the shelf. Even though it's still in my loan period"
"Try the money for 600k cucur cake online training, buy a good server so you don't keep crashing :)"
"After being updated, there's an error... I want to borrow the download, it's taking so long, it's gone, when I log out when I want to enter again, it says the server data doesn't exist..üò≤"
"Lately, the application can't be used, and it often crashes, please follow up kk, greetings literacy"
"Two stars first. I just downloaded it and when I want to enter, I can't really, an error has occurred. How about this?"
Very nice
"Excuse me, I've logged in before but after updating, I have to re-login. It was very difficult to log in before, especially via Facebook. Please fix the login problem. How long do I have to wait to be able to login :("
"Thank you for this cool application, reading can be anywhere and anytime plus it's free too. hopefully in the future the application will be even better, sometimes it always crashes. but the most important thing is that this application is really useful to pass the time, add knowledge anywhere, T.O.P.. üëçüëçüëç"
"Please fix it, there is a problem when borrowing a book, thank you very much"
I have downloaded the ipusnas application. But why can't I log in to my account? Please help. Thx
"The collection is quite complete. The display now has more choices but the design is less attractive, the book mode is not like it used to be"
I have downloaded 3 books to the bookshelf. But nothing can be read. Every time you click it always force close. I'm upset. I'm using realme c2
How come now the book can't be downloaded and it often crashes
Can read books for free... The books are quite completeüëç from novels to reference books there are
"Sorry, the stock for borrowing books from this app is lacking. I borrowed the book ""Earth"" by Tere Liye, but the stock for borrowing has run out, even though I'm really curious about the novel, so I ask for more borrowing stock"
It's complicated and a big nation sucks in which there is text
"Thank you, this apk is quite helpful for me to find reference books in doing research article assignments. During a pandemic like this it is difficult to go to the library, with this apk I find it helpful. I hope the scientific book collection will be more complete"
I don't know the apk bro.
I can't borrow a book. Install
"Assalamualaikum sir. I like reading books here because they are easy to access and the borrowing process is easy. because the distance between the library and my house is far. thank you this application helps me to be more fond of reading. Enter me, that is maybe it can be used as dark mode because my eyes are often tired when I look at the cellphone screen, especially the bright one."" Thank you. I hope it can be processed, thank you"
"A solid experiment from the Indonesian National Library of Indonesia has tried to present an online library, although there are many things that need to be improved here and there"
"Application is broken, data retrieval from server always fails."
"Why can't I log in, an error occurred, No DLS please fix it"
Can't login.
Why can't I open the apk???
"Ipusnas really can't be accessed, it's always an error even though it's using wifi. Why?"
I really like this application....but sometimes the error can't be opened...if it's being repaired it takes a long time...hopefully it will be fixed soon...
"I was disappointed, several times I tried to open the application but it still couldn't."
"I really like this application because it can accompany me in my spare time. But if it crashes, it can take hours and even days it can't be accessed. It's loading, network errors, page loading problems. Everything, even though the signal is all good. Upgrade it!"
"Very happy with this application. It's a shame it's currently under repair so I can't access it even though I really want to read it, hopefully it'll be back to normal soon. Amen!"
"Sorry, this application sometimes loses network when reloading books, sometimes when you want to log in using Facebook you have to uninstall and then install again"
"Just installed ""Unable to connect to server and no DLS"". There is no explanation, I don't understand"
Why can't the application be accessed?
"Connection problems often occur, even though my private network is safe and smooth."
"Now I can't login to Ipusnas, what's wrong?"
"Extraordinary. It's just that I see that on the Play Store there are many library applications for institutions and government units, which generally have the same form as iPusnas, with some content similar to iPusnas, some have collections that iPusnas does not have. Wouldn't it be better if instead of having many applications, just one one-stop application was made where all collections of these applications could be directly accessed? Maybe it can be considered üôèüèæ"
"I've logged in via fb and email but I can't log in. How come this application can't be used, right!"
Why can't I borrow the book yet? Said it was accessible? When usually?
"Thank you in advance for providing a free online book-lending service like this, but let me ask, is the application still under maintenance? Because until now the application is still error. Thank you"
"It's actually good, but why does it often bug? Borrowed books like to suddenly disappear by themselves, even though they should still be borrowed. Often suddenly logs out on its own. The read progress percentage also doesn't seem to work, even though I've read almost half the book but the read progress is still 0%, and every time I open it returns to the start page even though I've read for example up to page 250, if I forget to bookmark it, I have to scrolling again :("
"Sorry in advance, I feel dissatisfied with the application because confirmation to facebook is always please wait and long, then the email verification always fails.. why is it.. please help"
"This app is very helpful, especially when I'm not working, it's good to add my knowledge. But sometimes this app gets errors, when I download the book the writing just disappears. Now the error again can't open the app.."
"I saw the reply in the review comment on 26/7/2020 it said it can be used again, but now I open it and want to borrow it, but it still has an error and can't be borrowed ... it used to be easy ... please fix it soon"
"Min, I'm sorry, please fix it as soon as possible ""no DLS"" over and over"
"Educate the nation. However, they often experience problems when borrowing books. Please fix it immediately so that disturbances like this don't happen often."
The application cannot be opened. I have tried many times and checked the connection and the result is still the same. Please fix..
"Sorry, Sis, this is Ipusnas, why does an error always occur (unable to retrieve data from the server and DLS) please fix it, how do I use it like this"
"Oh no wonder it can't be opened, it turns out that when I saw the review it was in the maintenance process anyway. I hope it will be soon because for those of us who like to read this kind of application, it is very useful."
"Previously, I gave 5 stars on the app, it's good, but now I can't enter the app, it says it can't retrieve server data and there's no DLS."
"Why is Ipusnas now so difficult to open? Every time you log in, you always re-register the account.?"
Please fix the application. Can't download books today
Why can't it be opened? The reads cannot read DLS data. Why is that?
"Good night . I'm sorry, I just installed this, but I can't open it, the error continues. I wonder why? can you please help. Thank you"
"Very good for improving literacy. However, why can't I access? Is it an error? Even though I have updated the application and the signal is full. Please fix it. Thank you"
"It contains a lot of abundant knowledge, but please fix the app again because it often makes errors,"
"Very helpful for students to find various reference books that they want, right?"
"Very good and useful.. The best place to read books right now.. Original, not pirated, high quality and FREE... Thank you for your hard work.."
How come you still can't borrow a book.. Is it still under maintenance??
Previously it was fine and very helpful even though some books were missing. But today I want to borrow my bku and it keeps failing. How long do you think this maintenance will last?
Why have borrowed books always failed?
if you borrow a book it always fails
This application is very helpful for finding book references. But when I want to borrow there is always an error loading data even though the network is fine. I hope this app is fixed soon. Thank you :)
Why do you want to borrow a book for server maintenance? How long is it like this?
"I really like reading books at Ipusnas, but a few days, until today I still can't borrow books, whether it's a problem or still in the maintenance process.. hopefully it can be resolved quickly.."
The apk is good. But why are you logging out so often lately?
Why do you often go out alone?
"Good application, just lacking the search feature, it should be fixed"
"The application can't be used again, it has been going on for 4 days due to the maintenance process... it's too long so I can't borrow books"
"Very good, very useful, this is a suggestion, min: ""Please add a week for the duration of borrowing the book, it's okay"""
I'm sorry... it was good at first... but after that why did the error keep going... what's wrong with this app???
"He said the application can run, but can't borrow books because it keeps getting errors. Please run the application again in the midst of a pandemic like this."
"Very helpful. Unfortunately, there are often errors, the search is also inconvenient, the cover size is not balanced, please fix it when the National Library application loses to the online platform :("
"After updating, I think it's getting uglier than it started. Starting from applications that often lag, to bookmarks that don't work. I have to scroll continuously, even though I've bookmarked it. The application also often exits by itself"
"Yesterday I really couldn't access Ipusnas... Then finally I could... I thought it was fixed.. But it still seems like there's no improvement... in fact I can't borrow booksüòî... Even though this is the most special application for me those who like to read, especially at this time.. Please fix ipusnas immediately"
Why can't you borrow it yet? Errors keep on
When do you think the maintenance will be finished? Please give a valid and correct time... Because we already need books to read and borrow...
Good.. but need books with famous authors..especially in the field of education...but still cool..top
Wow a lot of good changes
"Why does every time you want to read a book that you have borrowed you return to the homepage or even have to download it again, even though the download has already been completed"
"Why does the application like to go out on its own, just download it when you want to read the application, please fix it immediately"
"Very good, there are many books, but there is a problem when I want to mark the pages of books that have been read."
"Good applications and lots of books, we just have to choose what we are looking for. Indeed not all titles exist, but passable. Please make more books. Indeed sometimes we can not access smoothly. Maybe the admin is on vacation Anyway, thank you"
Thank you ipusnas
Thank God it's back to normal. Thank you admins!
Please give the tutorial when you want to borrow the book
"Lately I've been having trouble accessing books, even though the internet connection is stable. Please fix it immediately. That is all and thank you."
"It's good, it's normal, hopefully the book collection can increase üòçüòç"
"Often goes out alone Edit : thanks for responding well, and for fixing it..."
"Thank you, today I have started to be able to read again through the application"
Very useful application.. :)
I really like this application. Thank you
Very cool sir thank you very much
It's enough
The app is good. I think it would be even better if there was a reading whish list. So readers don't forget the titles of the books they want to read.
good
Excellent
Can be downloaded but can't log in on Samsung Tab S
"After a long maintenance, finally iPusnas can work again, thanks.."
"Very good application, thank you ipusnas team üòäüòäüôè"
"Sorry, I have logged in but suddenly asked to log in again, and I can't continue when I log in. Please helpüôè"
"Please fix the application immediately, because we need referencesüôèüôèüôè"
"Why is there a problem with the application, can't open it at all"
"Many times I want to borrow a book but it fails ""network timeout"" even though my network has no problems, at first it was difficult to log in, please, please fix the application"
"I just registered last week, at first it was easy to borrow and read the books.... but today I can't open and even borrow books. Then, what's even more confusing, why does the system keep going mental? Then go back to logging in again. Meanwhile, I really need literacy resources from books in the library, for my college needs. Please help, Sir/Madam Admin... because actually the iPusnas program is really good, really helpful, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic this. Thank you"
"The application is very useful, you can borrow books digitally and for free :D. Can read and read while on public transportation. The system problem, please fix it immediately, I'm having a hard time borrowing books from last Wednesday, July 22 until now, even though I want new reading material this weekend."
"The history of the books is put together in the sense that the books don't have to be too many according to how many times they've been borrowed, so that you know more about how many books you've read. It's hard to log in to fb and borrow books and the server timeouts."
"A very helpful app, but fix the app again, the connection is good but it's hard to enter."
"I can't open the developer, sleep, click"
"really describes the character of the nation, this application. It's free, but most of the errors can't be opened. This is a country where the quality is like this. Reading is one of the positive hobbies for the nation's intelligence. It should be fixed so that all generations of the nation have a hobby of reading. Free, good quality, and a large collection of books. Let all the paid online reading applications disappear. Gpp already paid Ipusnas as long as it's cheap and affordable but the system and quality are good."
"Don't because of this, borrowing a book for free is so difficult when you want to borrow it. Even though the network and data packets are also not a problem, you know."
"After reading other reviews, it turns out that I'm not alone, I've been queuing for Grandmother Sapardi's books, when they are available it's even difficult to borrow, it means that the application is having problems, right. Okay, fortunately there is still stock on the borrowed bookshelf üòä greetings literacy"
"It's actually good, but the ""network timeout"" problem is very annoying, even though my internet is smooth. The loading takes a long time and I can't borrow books at all, and for the outside book collection, it's a bit lacking, even though the books I'm looking for are popular books. A bit disappointing. Hopefully it can be improved in the future."
Can't read the book :) comes out alone
Thank you
"Two days without opening the app. When you want to find another book and you want to borrow it, you suddenly have to log in like that. Yes, I have filled in my email and password again. However, I can't keep logging in. Don't know why. There isn't any change. There is no information why. I just repeatedly clicked log in."
"Why can't I open the app, even though I just downloaded it."
"It's like this, I used this application before it went smoothly, now when I opened it after a long time it seemed really slow. Even though the network is okay, opening other apks is smooth, but Ipusnas is like that, then I try to uninstall it first, then install it again, now when I open Ipusnas I can't even enter. Eh, now I can enter, but it's loading just fine, even though the network is okay. I can't borrow a book haha"
"The application cannot be opened, it says ""an error occurred"" ""unable to retrieve data from the server and no DLS"" even though last night it was still able to be opened,üòû"
The server is very difficult to reach. Please fix it
"The application is bad, please fix the errors and shortcomings"
"How come when I download it can't be opened? It says ""Data could not be retrieved from server or DLS is not available"" why?"
"Sis, it's been 3 days without being able to borrow books, is there any improvement?"
"Previously, thank you, this application is very useful. I often borrow books, but lately, why is it often maintenance from not being able to borrow books, failing to load books, etc. until I couldn't log in anymore, it was difficult to participate in school literacy activities."
Why can't it be opened?
"The app is very helpful. Especially at this time, can not borrow books on campus. But these few days why can't it be borrowed? Even though I still need it.."
"It's good, it's just that after the update, how come it often gets errors. Especially when you want to download the book. But, the books are really good, keep on improving"
"The server crashed after the update, please fix it."
"I like that Ipusnas is very helpful for those who like to read books. But why do you like to logout yourself and then you can't log in, right? So hard"
I've downloaded it but how come it doesn't open?
"just installed but why can't it be opened, server error and can't retrieve data Why?????"
Why can't the details of the book be opened
what application is this useless for librarians can't open the server error just throw it away .... please the government give the librarian an application to support children learning online what else during the covid period like this
"It's actually easy to use, cool. Just why so often errors? Log out yourself, log in is very difficult. How long is the maintenance? During this pandemic, it's actually really suitable to read books in this application. Hopefully it's better not to make frequent errors. Haha"
Sorry. How come you can't log in? Said there was no DLS. What does DLS mean?
"First network error, even though wifi+signal is good."
"Why am I looking for a book in each category.. the writing has no data.. what happened? Is this apk bug? Is my phone the error? But the rest of the apk works fine.. please, what is this.. so I can't read.. is there really a time limit for reading the book?? What's up?? How do you not know this..."
"I can't borrow books, at ipusnas. I really want to read the book I've been waiting for a long time."
"very useful, for completeness it is still lacking, often server errors even though the signal is good. please fix again :)"
"Why can't it be opened, bro? When you want to open it, it says ""unable to retrieve data from server and no DLS"", what do you mean, min?"
"Why can't I borrow a book, then the application comes out by itself.."
"I'm sorry, the app often won't open. every time you want to borrow it keeps failing"
why am I having trouble logging in even though the internet connection is fine
I'm having a hard time borrowing a book. I have clicked borrow but the optional book doesn't appear. Stuck.
"Dear Ipusnas, why can't your application be opened? Why does the DSL problem appear?"
"This application is very helpful for students like me who are looking for references for their thesis during a pandemic like this. It's a shame the app still crashes, I logout myself. I can't open it when I open it, even though the internet connection is smooth, when I uninstall and install it again I can't log in with the same email. Please fix it soon min"
I have installed it but can't open it.
why now want to borrow a book it takes so long to load? even today I want to borrow I can't. please fix
From yesterday yesterday ipusnas is still fine but now why is there an error even though the xiomi note 5 pro cellphone

"I used to be disappointed because it was difficult to log in, and then I can,, I've been using it for a long time, but how come I can't download books anymore, well, it's been more than a week... Please fix it for the developer, I want to read the book soon,"
"Thank you, very useful and helpful of course. During this pandemic, there is one thing you can do, namely read. Koi fish, sharks, ehe I love you. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
"After updating, there are often errors that can't borrow books. Please fix it again. At first it was comfortable, now it's a lot of errors"
Fix again..
"Thank God I can read books. I really appreciate and like this application. Unfortunately, it is difficult to log in when logged out by yourself. Hopefully this application can be further improved. Thank you"
"Alhamdulillah it's good, maybe the book is incomplete and for the sharing feature why can't it? it's really useful if users can share the e-book too"
"Why is the network timeout so early? I'm still reading, but I can't even use the application, it's really sad"
"Great app, too bad too many bugs. Network timeout even though the network is stable, loading takes a long time, the application exits by itself, it's really sad even though it wasn't like this before, after updating it got even worse :("
"I really like it, but the application often has problems and errors. Please fix. It's been really good though."
"At first it was easy to borrow a book. The longer it takes, how come you can't download the borrowed book. All books"
"Sis, when can Ipusnas be accessed again?"
"How come my account can't be logged in ""Unable to retrieve data from server and no DLS, close the application"" How come there's always a problem, bro?"
"I just downloaded it again, the app used to be good. Now loading is slow, borrow the booklet, the description is network time out. Please pay attentionüôè"
"I really like it..finally I'm starting to like reading books. Please help, if you can add more to the collection TERE LIYE :)"
"Very good application,But please fix it.Because there are often bugs when using it"
"Thank you in advance because this application really helped me. However, this morning I have been borrowing books for hours, to no avail. The information listed after failing to borrow the book, ""There was an error loading the book details; network timeout."" Though there are no problems with my signal and data network. Even before, I had trouble logging in to this app. Please fix...."
Greatly helped
good
Nice app
Why can't the application run? He said he couldn't get it from the server. How's that min?
"Very helpful and lots of good references, but if you can improve the books and hope that all categories of events from religion are also good and maybe it needs to be fixed so that when it's downloaded, it's downloaded, because sometimes it's already downloaded and it's not being downloaded again."
"The application is good, but why is it a little error huh? Please fix as soon as possible, thank you"
reservoir cost
"Thank you to those who have made the ipusnas application which makes it easier for me to read books through the application and look for some books related to my courses but there needs to be a slight improvement in this application because there are several things that then disappointed me because I tried login turns out I can't log in then the book I borrowed doesn't work anymore, I tried re-logging in but it still doesn't work I beg for this to be handled properly"
"Good, keep updating the application so it's better"
"Min, how come it's been an error for a few days?"
Many of books
"I have downloaded the application, I have also registered via email. It's just that I want to borrow in the download process, how come it says ""File doesn't exist""? please fix. Because if the iPusnas apk is repaired, it will be very helpful for students during this pandemic"
"Optimistic that Indonesia will progress, if everyone can share knowledge with each other"
I have registered but cannot download/borrow because there is no email for verification. Please provide a solution because this is my first time using iPusnasüôèüèª

Excused..
"Even though the application is under maintenance, at least I appreciate the good breakthroughs from the Indonesian national library, keep moving forward and never give up for the sake of a broad-minded Indonesia"
"Makes it easier to read, you know"
Why can't I go to Ipusnas.. the internet connection is good but it doesn't work.. where's the error?
"Still doing maintenance, min? I can't enter trs"
why can't it be opened after downloading the application
I can't open the app why?
For now I give 3 stars first.
Error already ah..
"Why is it that every time I want to register the password is always invalid, even though I check the password is not wrong, please help"
I really like Ipusnas. Online library solution when lazy to go to bookstores. Very practical! Whenever and wherever you can read through Ipusnas
This application is very good .. because the current situation does not allow to go out so be grateful that there is this application so I can do the task ... Thank you very much sis.. hopefully it can be even better
long login
"Dear ipusnas team, now how come I can't take screenshots of the application anymore, how come the features of the previous version were removed including color changes when reading, I'm a bit disappointed with this update because I like to quote sentences in books using screenshots. Please make the color change feature again and allow screenshots because it's quite annoying, literacy greetings, I hope it will be answered."
"Hello, why can't my application be bookmarked?"
"I'm giving it five stars, not because it's really good and there's nothing to improve, but because I know that most people who want to try to download it must first look at the rating and how many have downloaded. Honestly, the application is good, but in my opinion there are some things that are lacking, for example the choice of too many book categories should be reduced so that it is more general. I also think it's best to add a popular list besides that the background when reading should also be changed to dark mode."
Please add doraemon comic book üôèüôè
Sorry. Why is it so difficult to borrow books..
"My advice is to increase the number of non-fiction books, especially science textbooks, which have the smell of motivation, translation books, and best-selling books."
"Why is the screen reading time not locked? There must be a page description and a sign of disturbing reading. It's weird, it makes you uncomfortable, though. Good old model. Full page is not covered up!"
Thank you iPusnas. Please expand the collection of books. Especially about self-development
yea i can finally read it
"Good application and very useful. Please fix the ""dark background"" mode, it says active but not working."
GreatüëçüëçThe application is very useful.. Very helpfulüëç

"Hello, iPusnas. I can't download books :( I can already min, thank you, the internet turns out to be awwwwwwwww üôèüôèüôèüôèüôè"
"The collection is quite complete, unfortunately, it still often experiences errors and lagging when you just open the app. Btw for ipusnas, how do you borrow a book that is out of stock, aka someone else is borrowing it? I often wait but never get the book. Overall great, greetings literacy."
This is great it makes it easier for me to read books and find references for my assignments

Why can't I download a book that has been borrowed? And how come the level down? Is this an error or what? Yesterday yesterday even though I really liked this apk.
"Very nice. Read premium free, which has a maturity"
"Thank you for making this online library... My suggestion: Increase the number of book references, especially for non-fiction books and please improve the appearance of the book.. It is better for the book to maintain the structure of the book than to change its structure and adapt it to cellphone writing.. Not very good"
very good and helpful.. please always improve the application üòä
Awesome!
Very useful
The network often crashes. Please fix yawww ^_^
Why is it like this even though I have verified my email and email have also been registered and I have also become a member but why when I want to borrow a book..it says email verification..that's it..trs if the email has not been verified with ipusnas... contact ipusnas how about you please..

"A very useful app, hopefully it can be even better."
"How come you can't? Tell me to login using FB / email first. I've logged in but it's still stuck on the login page. I repeat many times still. Lots of data, 4G signal, sometimes Wi-Fi shows but still can't. Fix it right away. There's no longer a place to read books that are legal if Ipusnas can't do it"
At iPusnas we can only read 3 books but it's really fun to read that's why I give 5 stars
"Great app! Books that I haven't had time to buy, I can actually read in this application. Improve literacy culture and fill activities at home during WFH. Thank you!"
Why am I having trouble logging in via fb or email?
"Good too, unfortunately the book is not complete. Please add HISTORY NOVEL BOOK..."
"Thanks to the developers for the creation of this application. Honestly, this really helped me in finding extensive but free reading resources. By reading we have formed a superior SDM."
"This isn't a teen novel, is it? A kind of novel published from wattpad??"
Why is it that after it's installed... email verification says... when I click it... it doesn't appear vAlid

Long time to queue

Nice apk very helpful
Good application. Very helpfulüòáüòáüëçüëç
"Thank you for making an application that is very useful for many people, including me. I used to be a loyal ipusnas user, then i don't use ipusnas anymore because there are still many bugs, long logging in, borrowed books don't show up, etc. After a while it turned out that I received news that the ipusnas application had no bugs, I downloaded it again. I've only been using it for a few weeks, but the old ipusnas bug appears again. Thanks again very much, but sorry I'm a bit disappointed."
More books on hospitality science and hotel management
"Crazy, I'm addicted to reading because of this app"
"Thank you National Library for providing books for free, but it would be nice if it was immediately activated, such as going directly to the destination page and saving pages that cannot be accessed"
nice
"Very helpful in the midst of a pandemic like this. Thank you üôè the application is also light and easy. Maybe you can add a favorite book feature so that if you accidentally see an interesting book on the veranda, you can save it to your favorite book"
"It's good, it's just hard to get a book because it's fast"
"Thanks, just found out about this application, apart from adding knowledge, we are also taught that it's better to read here legally than buying pirated ones, so we can appreciate the authors, the best"
"Is it not complete with the latest books*? Looking for the title of the book, how come I always can't find what I want, it can be improved again for completeness. This application is very useful."
Truly extraordinary
"I have logged in several times but I can't, why?"
The application is very useful for me who likes to read on my cellphone... the books are also quite a lot. My suggestion is that the application is further improved so that there are no problems in borrowing the rest is quite good. Hopefully this application can always make a good contribution for its users to increase reading interest in the Indonesian people in the future üëçüëç
I wish the books available were more complete.

"Hello.. this is my first time using this application and it makes it easier for me to borrow books, but after logging in and borrowing books, why can't I download it? Here it says ""file not found"" after the download button is pressed and likes to force close immediately. Then the book cover that has been downloaded also does not appear and loading takes a long time to appear. The internet network is also well connected, no problem. Please help. Thank you"
"In the book it is necessary to add looking for pages or word suv, thank you kk."
Adding insight
"This application is very good, but unfortunately cannot be accessed by blind people. Please in the future the application can be accessed by screen readers or screen readers so that it can be accessed by people with visual impairments, because currently many have taken their education to college, because this apk contains many books that can be borrowed and used as references for compiling college final assignments or thesis . I am one of the low vision blind people."
I've tried logging in but can't log in
The app is very helpful... Thanks
Like
"It's good even though the number of books to read is incomplete, but the idea is really good for the government to increase interest in reading Indonesian people, especially millennials, there are still many inconvenience problems, I hope the government can be serious in developing these apps because the idea is really good"
"How come I want to borrow a book but I can't, sorry"
good
"First of all, it's ok to install, I'm happy because there are lots of books in stock that you can read, then suddenly one day the app gets cranky, doesn't want to open the book. Then I uninstalled it, a week later I installed it again, but I still can't open the book. Why is this happening huh? please solution.."
"The application is good, the only problem is the download is very slow"
Very helpful
"Hello, Ipusnas. It's been a few days why the application can not be opened huh? Just playing around even though the signal is good."
"Bro I have installed the application. I want to login, but, please wait a very long time. I've tried several times, still long. How do you log in so it's a bit faster, bro?"
Why can't I download the book I want to borrow? Usually it can be downloaded... even though the app was recently updated too
"It's good that there are more books than when I first downloaded it. But unfortunately, there are still errors that need improvement. I have borrowed a book but it can't be downloaded. The interface begs to be further improved to make it more comfortable to use. Thank you"
"How come this ipusnas application is not like it used to be? Usually if I download the book I want to read, the book can be downloaded as it should, but why is it that when I'm downloading the book I want to read-up to a certain percentage, suddenly the display prompts me to download the book again. I can't read books like this."
"3 stars first, yes. Because I just downloaded it tonight."
Just try
"I really like the iPusnas application, after it was updated there was a little development. Suggestions for using it better for iPusnas: 1. If possible, increase the collection of books from various publishers, especially the collections of best-selling authors. 2. If the stock of books runs out and you have to queue, if possible use the queue number so that we who are in line can borrow books without fighting. It's been three weeks and I haven't gotten Tere Liye's book yet. That is all and thank you"
This application is very useful
"The app is really good, so I can read free books every day. But the application can't go straight to the last reading when I open the book again. Even to the first page. And you have to scroll one by one, luckily if you remember where you last read it. Please fix it.. hopefully more and more people will read books on ipusnas"
Why is it a bug? The book can't be opened
"Permission to give suggestions for iPusnas : 1. User reading history can be sorted by user. So that the reading history on the user account can be a place for book recommendations. For example, there is a book that the user does not recommend can be deleted from the history. 2. There is a wishlist, so users are no longer confused about finding the book they want to read. 3. Adding the number of books that have a very large waiting list so that users don't have to wait long in queues. Thank you, success always"
"Please fix the loan system. I borrowed the book in the afternoon, how come it wasn't there at night and all of them had been borrowed. Once again, please improve the book borrowing system so that this IPUDNAS can be better. Thank you"
"I gave 3 stars first because I just tried this application, the first time I tried to borrow a book the application still needed to be fixed because there were always network error notifications, and when I just re-opened the application it still gave a network error notification even though my cellphone signal was good. Please fix it üôè because judging by the other reviews the contents of the books are good, thank you"
"After updating, why can't I borrow?"
"Previously, thank you very much for making the ipusnas application, this is very useful for me who is a student during this lockdown so we have to do online school. But I want to ask why the login takes so long I've waited for hours but can't access the book I want, I've checked the signal and the internet quota is also good, but why does it take so long to load? Is that possible? Please help üôèüôèüôè Thank you"
Sis why do you always get an error
Luka can read novels here for free. Coolüëåüíñ‚ù§
"I've downloaded the apk, I've borrowed a book, but when I want to read, the app comes out. So how do I read the book?"
"Books that accompany the flow of communist ideology, don't enter, you have to be selective"
How do I stop the notification.. I've queued and I've read.. but the notification is still there and it's very annoying...
"I like errors, even though this app used to be great. Now I often log out myself, 0 copies of books, hard to download books etc. Later when the application is stable and good as before I will change the star."
"Even though ipusnas is a very good application, it is a pity that it is very rare to update translated novels anymore, both adding old translated novels and new novels. I don't know how many times I have to re-read the same novel. Even though it had never been this long, and said it would be updated gradually, but nothing."
Greatly helped
"Why can't my account login? is there any problem min. I hope my account can still be used as before, because there are still many books that I want to read. please fix it asap so i can use it again."
Really errors
"A very good application for those of you who want to read books without buying. Nb: instead of buying pirated books, better read books here"
"There is a problem on the network even though I have cleared the cache, for the reading system, please put a marker so it doesn't scroll again if you want to read it again"
It's starting to get better.. thank you
How do you make an account?
"There are many choices of books.. it's a shame that the application itself always comes out every time I want to read a borrowed book... Developers please, hopefully it will be fixed quickly,"
"Thank you for providing a very useful application for book lovers, hopefully there will be more interest in reading Indonesian people"
mantop good
"The application is good, recommended for all young generations to cultivate literacy"
Very helpful
"First of all, thank you for making this ipusnas app, thank God I can read free books, but it's a shame the books aren't updated or what are the games, good novels, please add more, I'll add a rating later. Thank you :)"
"Cool, but still incomplete. Haha.."
üëçüèÜ
"When it was first downloaded, it was used smoothly. But why lately, every time you open the application you have to log in and when you refresh the book search, or want to read a book that has been downloaded, you can't. Please help, thank you."
"less comfortable to use, not yet user friendly, at the beginning there is only a login without a list, the download speed is very long, add the fast scol feature"
"Min, I can't download, I have to verify my email"
"Hahhhh.... I'm tired of using this application, I like to go out alone, it's a shame even though the book collection is pretty good."
"This application is very useful and very helpful for doing tasks. But I'm sorry in advance, today when I opened Ipusnas, why does it keep getting errors, right? When I press download it can't üôèüò≠"
"Can't open at all. I have re-installed several times. Still, can't open it. Even back home again and again."
"Thank you very useful. There are some problems, but they always seem to be trying to fix it."
"When it's out, I forget my password, the link sent to the email can't be used. 'Error', what should I do, fix the application, please"
"How come it's an error, min?"
At first it's good to add insight when you can't physically hold a book. But why now always fail to see the details of the book
"Sorry, why did the application suddenly log out by itself? Keep logging in again can't. Please let me know, thank you"
Good and many choices
Trooos error every time I open
"The collection of books is added again, bro, mimin hehe..."
"Hello sis! I just downloaded it today but there is always a notification ""you haven't verified your email"" even though it's already verified. Thank you."
"I'm really disappointed with the current Inpusnas, it's very difficult to login. Email doesn't work, Facebook does not load for long and it doesn't work. Whereas last year it was fun to read books through Ipusnas. Easy not complicated. Totally different now. I don't know whyüòï. DISAPPOINTED lahhhhhhhhhhhhh"
"it used to be good, why not? eh, when I rarely use it, then I use it again, I get an error. I like to log out myself, but when I log in, it's really hard. once you can log in, it's really bad. even though the signal is really good. It's also hard to borrow the book. Well, I was so annoyed that I uninstalled it. really good. but I don't know why it's like that :(("
prime
"Why is this so often errors, it's also difficult to borrow books to download, please fix it immediately, because during this pandemic Ipusnas is really needed to find references in doing assignments and theses."
"Bro, add a fast scroll feature, so it's nice if you want to read the end of the page. Hehe, that's so and so.. I think if you add a place for discussion groups, it will be cool.. Then so and so.. when I change my profile picture, my photo is still blank.. That's all my negative comments. Hopefully in the future it will be better. Greetings literacy!"
"It's hard to access and then I log out myself suddenly, I don't even want to borrow a book."
"Why do I often get errors, I can't borrow books"
"The loan period has been extended, bro"
"How long will the maintenance last, iPusnas? The problem is that I just don't download it, and I can't read the book..."
Very useful
Bad can't open
"How come I can't see the old info on borrowing and the option to return the book, right?"
Very Likeüëçüèªüñ§
It is very good and deserves to be appreciated. It just needs to be improved and developed again for the convenience of the reader.
"This is why every time I log in, it says: Ipusnas has stopped, is there currently maintenance?"
"Is there a writing marker feature to mark very important information in the book being read? If the information is on the website, you can, but how come when in the application there is no feature, right? Can be explained?"
"Thank you Ipusnas for the response, and it can be used even though it is often slow to download, please let me know if it is possible for Ipusnas readers to recommend books because there are some books that I want to read but can't be found on Ipusnas. Thank you"
loading takes a long time even though the signal is good. when clicked does not respond
This application is quite helpful for me in finding books and improving the literacy of the nation's children. Please improve again
"There are many good books, but unfortunately some books take a long time to download, often repeat 1%, even fail to download"
"This app means a lot to book enthusiasts who don't mind reading digitally! I really appreciate it. Unfortunately, too many bugs: account logout by itself, long loading or network time out even though the internet connection is fine, force close, not clean display, bad scrolling experience, and difficult to log back in. Please ask the National Library of Indonesia so that this application can be developed more seriously. Thank you"
"At first it was good, after a while it didn't work, so I uninstalled it, then I reinstalled it, it doesn't work"
"The application is very useful. Easy to read anywhere anytime. But why lately the application has an error, it's hard to borrow the book??? Please fix it soon..... thank you."
"Why can't my Ipusnas borrow books? On the other hand, if the return is so easy. The signal thing, even though it's quite good."
"The app is really good. Only, one of me, please fix it immediately. The online books here are very useful, it's just that there are bugs that often make errors that cause inconvenience to the reader. Please fix soon. Thank you very much üôè"
How come the application can't be opened??
"Sis, why can't I log in, it says it can't retrieve data from the server and there's no DLS.. Why huh??"
The app is good. But why has it been two days now that the error has been entered but can't borrow. I wonder why???
the apk is good. so add insight into his knowledge.
"As for the application, it's good, just a suggestion if you can give a star/favorite feature to mark the book I'm interested in so that at any time if you want to borrow it, just go to the favorite column, so it's good if you want to find books that interest me, or planned to read tomorrow"
"This application is very interesting and helped me in finding some references. However, unfortunately the last few days iPusnas has been difficult to access."
"I really like reading books on Ipusnas, especially for me who prefers to read books on my cellphone, there are all genres. More Islamic books, thank you Ipusnas"
"The ipusnas application is really helpful, especially for students who need references. But as of June 21, 2020 until now, the application often has errors, cannot borrow books. Please really fix the system..because many people need this applicationüôè. Thank you"
"Sis, why does this keep getting errors?"
"can not be expressed in words, for sure his complaint is almost the same as the others. Ô∏è"
Why did he suddenly come out
"Can't open the application, it says Can't retrieve data from server and no DLS. How is it?"
"The ePustaka is why when you click it, the error continues to not load. I gave two stars first because I can't borrow books."
"Thanks to Ipusnas for making it easier for me to read the books I dream of, especially the series of novels by Agatha Christie. However, lately there have been a lot of problems. Since this morning I can't even log into the Ipusnas application! Even though there is a book that I have to finish and I am very curious about the ending. When I try to login, it definitely says: ""Unable to fetch data from server and no DLS."" Hope it can be fixed!"
"The application made by iPusnas is very helpful in finding & reading books that I can't afford. The borrowing method is easy even though there are often errors because there may be problems with the application. I hope this application needs to be improved & developed again, especially the appearance of the application must be attractive & comfortable for the readers."
"when you want to borrow, the library list can't always be displayed. Trying other applications is safe though. Q"
Very useful application. Hopefully this application can return to normal as before.
Very helpful
good
There are still many shortcomings.. There are still many books whose writings are lost..
"Quite helpful, can borrow too"
Level up again
Very useful for society. Hopefully more books will be available.
why is it slow to open it even though the network is good
"5 stars even though it's been a few days the app can't be used. Is it still maintenance? Whatever I take my hat off for this application, I think the government should provide a special budget for the development of this application, hire professional IT experts to make the application better and more perfect, strengthen the server so that the application is more stable. I'm sure we agree with the phrase ""a developed nation is a nation that likes to read"". ipusnas is an amazing idea in this digital era. Regards ir. Ferguso. S.e m.m.c"
"why does it often get an error, how about this, please fix it immediately. want to borrow a book, always network time out"
"After updating, how come it's slow and the books can't be accessed, even though I'm really happy to have a free online library like this....."
"Thank you, IPusnas has helped a lot. But for now it can't be used Please fix it quickly. Thank you"
"Krmn about a month ago using this application is good without any problems. Now, how come I often log out myself, it's already difficult to log in. I want to borrow a book and it keeps failing. Even though online libraries during a pandemic like this are really needed by students to find study materials."
"Actually the application is good and useful, it's just not user friendly, it's even better if the preload is made lighter, it's not easy to leave the reading page, and there is a delete history feature. The rest is cool."
"Sorry, admin, I gave 2 stars. Why has the application been crashing lately? Suddenly logs out on its own. It's hard to log in again. If you're logged in, it's hard to access anything. Please fix it, min, because this application is very helpfulüôè"
Very nice
It's been good
"This application is very helpful in finding reference sources. It's just that lately errors often occur, even those that cannot be opened. Please for the developer to eliminate this problem. Thank you... As of June 21, 2020, the application experienced a problem so it could not enter the homepage. It was precisely after I updated it that I thought would fix the existing problem. Ask the developer to solve the problem. Thank you..."
Not much collection of books
There are still frequent errors when going to borrow books and several times the application has to log back in/log out itself
steady
"why can't you borrow a book? Log out yourself, no loan history, no book loans, oh how come the application can't be relied on like this, huh? Ô∏è"
"Still no progress... It's been updated to the latest version, but it's slow, sorry.. Auto uninstall is better."
"It's cool to be able to read books through a smartphone, but please add to the collection."
"Often have problems with the signal, even though my signal has no problems, loading tends to fail. Then the reader is not comfortable, scrolling is difficult and there is no option to search for pages in the app, on PC there is a word search feature. And add a wishlist feature so that it can be used even if the book stock has not run out, because the wishlist can only work if the book stock runs out. Thank you"
"How come I logged out myself, when I logged in it was so difficult... so I couldn't log in even though there were some books being read"
"Every time I see a book I want to borrow, I get an error and I can't refresh it.."
"really bad. since the update even more errors. I can't ss, it's hard to return a book, it's hard to borrow a book, it can't be refreshed"" even though the connections are all good. It's really bad, please improve it again."
"How come there are so many errors at the end, huh?"
"Sorry admin. Mine still can't be opened. Every time you open a book, the server timeout will come out. Please fix. It's a waste of time for the apk, right?"
The application is not user friendly
"The application is really good, it's just that it takes a very short time to borrow the book."
Easy to access
"Very good application, lots of books to read. But the name is also free, there are often bugs, those who take care of it don't want to"
"I really appreciate this application, also until now. But these few days the application seems to have frequent errors. Suddenly logging out by yourself, notifications are also problematic, including during the book borrowing process. Please fix it üôè ""You can read books from various genres as much as you want without paying ... thank you. This application is very helpful"" üòä"
Good but there is no word search feature like in iOS
"The application is good and very helpful for those who like to read but have a hard time with funds to buy a lot of books, the books are also quite complete. But what sometimes makes this application resentful is that it sometimes logs out by itself. Hopefully this problem will be fixed soon and the book collection will be complete"
"Sorry in advance, I can't load the borrowed book and can't download it. I've also checked for other books on the main screen and they look the same, no cover images, titles, book details and more. It also says ""time out"" or a problem while loading. The internet has also been connected and connected and immediately after that force close or return to the main menu. How is this admin? Does it affect the type of cellphone or what? Please help"
Can't download even though the book is available..please fix it soon
Very nice
How come the books can't be accessed now?
why can't i log in min???
"It's really hard to read the book. The network is smooth and victorious. Clear cache clear data is the same, Ask for downloads but there is no download process."
"Can't log in, man, please fix the app"
"At first it was really good, the first few days it was still smooth, but getting here, I like not being able to download the ebook or I like to go out on my own from my account. The login is also often the same error when resetting the web password is an error. Please fix it, thank you."
good
The collection of books is quite large. But it's a shame that there are so many errors that it slows down my work.
good
"Why is it that when I open this application using data, ""an error occurred."" Then I tried again, the error occurred again, then I re-entered this application, I was able to enter but it was loading and ""no data"" why is that"
"Why can't I download the book, the response continues to be an error, I've also updated the application but it's still the same error. Please fix again, thank you"
"this is a book reading app right? why ask permission (permission) camera? is this a book reading app? Or read people's faces? ask seriously. fix the server first, the connection is good, the request timeout continues"
"The more you come here, the more difficult it is to use Ipusnas. I like to log out myself, it's really hard to log in again. Wanting to borrow a book, network timeouts are frequent, even though the network is still stable, trying to open other applications is also running smoothly. Please fix it as usual again"
"The application often errors, please fix it again."
"Why are you, how come I often log out and can't log in again"
Bad
"The app is very useful. But every time I borrow a book, the application always stops. In addition, there are frequent connection timeouts even though the network is smooth. Please fix"
Why can't you borrow a book? Even though I have updated
"Sorry in advance. Why do I want to log in using a fb account, it takes a long time to load?? and if you enter using that email, when you check your inbox on the website, the email provided in the email says ""Invalid data."" Please provide a solution..thanks.."
"For the search for books from yesterday can't work, always doesn't return results."
Why does this app often stop?üòè
"Hello ipusanas, the current state of ipusnas is not good, 1 can't find books 2, likes to be self-absorbed, please fix ipuanas for literacy progress. Pls fix ipusas I'm waiting for your recovery ipusnas üòä‚ò∫"
I've installed and uninstalled it many times... the application or the cellphone may still have problems with the internet connection..... when I borrowed it.... want to download a borrowed book it always gets stuck and it takes a while to download (wifi network) but if you connect to the provider the phone (internet mobile data package) immediately gets wet not long... different when connecting to wifi.. device: meizu m5 please fix it...if possible if cache is deleted.. doesn't affect the application..
"I apologize in advance, admin, I used to have downloaded Ipusnas and was able to use it, after I changed my cellphone, I downloaded it again, I couldn't borrow books, the reason that appeared I had not verified my email. Then I click the resend button. I checked my email account still no verification inbox. Please help, thanks in advance"
"Okay books are in Ipusnas. Even though the loan limit is only 3-5 days, at least ipusnas really gives us a comfortable reading experience that is actually free. From To King A Mockingbird to Zodiaque Academy there are. Great. Love ipusnas!"
Excellent
"Why should you use the Queue system? I think this app will grow my interest in reading, what a shame."
"Please fix the search engine, how come I'm looking for my friend's username but I can't find it, even though his username is already registered"
Shukron is very helpful
Hopefully better. I need a reference
"Why every time I want to open a book, the application has an error and exits?"
"In the past this book really helped me in learning many lessons. But why now I can't log in, I've uninstalled it many times and then downloaded it again, but it still can't be opened. Please fix again. I'll give more stars later."
Thank you iPusnas
"Hello Ipusnas, I want to ask, why lately I can't download books, right? The status is already a saved book, but when I want to read the download feature appears. And loading the download takes a long time, also if it is removed from the cover page of the book that is being downloaded, suddenly the download process that was currently running becomes deleted and has to be repeated again. Thank you in advance.."
The verification message to the email is not coming in. So you can't borrow books
üëç
"Assalamualaikum, min. I just installed this apk but why does an error occur, huh? Thank you"
"Why can't I open this application, after downloading it I tried to open it but the error continued."
"Sorry, why can't the application be opened, even though the application is good, please fix it"
Why can't the app login? Server error?
I really like this app üòä
"Why is it that every time I want to borrow a book, it keeps failing even though I have registered and sent it many times but no response, why is that? Please fix :)"
"Wait a minute, why does this APK need access to CHANGE SYSTEM SETTINGS bro? Why is something weird? Admin can you please explain!"
Very helpful app..
"Ipusnas, you broke my heart. I often go out alone! Log out, internet time out, error, good network though. The most lebay application, very frequent errors I've ever had. At first, it's good, it's long gone!! What to do? Why give 5 stars because of the large collection of books, if none of them can be read, downloaded, or borrowed. Hft, tay!"
Anyway it's cool
"Sorry, why does this keep getting timeouts? Even though in the beginning you can, and to be honest, this really helps a lot :("
"But how come today the error keeps popping up when I open it, asking to keep reloading"
The application often logs out and can't re-enter the password & have to reset the password again.
Ipusnas is not like it used to be. Troublesome.
Good bet
"This is where the government's role appears when the government presents a reading platform from the national library source, although there are some old books that are not here, but that doesn't reduce my pride in this application."
Why can't I borrow a book? Is it still a nuisance?
This application is very helpful and suitable for people who are interested in reading like me. But unfortunately there are still frequent errors and slow so it's a bit uncomfortable. Please improve more.
"Honestly, this application is very good compared to other similar applications, but how come the server is often down at night and can't be accessed, so even though it is very helpful, the quality of the server is lacking, I give 2 stars"
"This app is actually good, but I often experience bugs and time outs. In addition, my bookmarks are often lost. Sometimes it's difficult to download a book and it takes a long time to load even though my connection is good"
This supporting application is a must try!
Very nice. You can borrow digital novels that you can't buy.. that's great anyway..
Gives a lot of convenience for me who likes to read. Hopefully Indonesia will get more people who like to read books
good
"Thank you, very convenient to use and lots of good books to increase knowledge, and one more thing, it's free."
"The collection is good, complete. But it would be nice to multiply more copies for popular books. Again, the user interface has been improved again, it's good to make it more minimalist, simple, and modern."
Taik. can't enter.. data dls dick
"This app is very helpful, especially when looking for Dead Angle novels. I was confused because I couldn't find the digital version until the end. There is also a sample version. Finally fun to find the novel through this application. Unexpectedly, it was found immediately. And here are other novels like The Ghost Bride. But there is something that needs to be improved again, please, the pages in the digital book and the search engine are equipped because when I read the novel I had to scroll many times to keep reading."
"Very good, okay anyway"
"It would be better if there was a preview of a few pages of the book too, and hopefully the collection will be more complete"
The book collection is quite complete. Let's add more philosophy books.
"a very useful application, keep adding to the collection, oh yeah sometimes when you download you want to save old books"
"The more the collection of books is expanded, I am very happy because this national digital library is. Thank you"
"Incomplete, but cool!"
Why does the maintenance take so long.. I want to work on this assignment... pls hurry it up a bit.. the problem is I want to borrow a book for work
"Hi. If I'm honest, I like applications like this, it's official. But, lately, for some reason, the loan book can't be opened and it's forced to close. Please fix this. so much"
"Applications that help educate the nation, and I've been using this app for a long time, the good advice is that books are made unlimited, now it's a bit difficult to borrow books, there are queues because those who borrow from all over the country, thank you"
"Needs to be improved further, the apk likes to suddenly come out by itself after borrowing a book, finally it can't be read"
Healthy by reading.üêºüêºüêº
"Min, why lately the application often can't download the book. Suddenly there is a notification, file not found.üò´"
I wonder why? Why is it so hard to log in?
can you read the novel here?
"Now it's hard to download. Mostly there is a file not found. I need to fix it again, to make it easier for those who want to read. thanks"
"Sorry in advance sir/madam. Is there no Civil Engineering category book? I just downloaded and tried looking for V. Chow's Open Channel book, but couldn't find it. Even though I was in need of this book in online lectures. The search feature is also very random. I used the keyword Open Channel, which came up instead of story books. I also couldn't find the comic I was looking for."
Downloads are very long and often fail even though the book file is only 17mb and my signal is full. Please fix
thank you ipusnas
Best
Good and suitable for students and students who are looking for additional references for their scientific work
"Good, please multiply books for IT majors"
The IP address that bought it was us
"Bad application, why is it that every time you read a book that you have borrowed you download it again, is the first download not enough... how will the Indonesian people move forward if you are like this...."
"Why do I want to borrow, why does it keep failing, the loan exceeds the specified capacity even though I haven't borrowed any books today."
"I'm sorry, how are you trying to login using a Facebook/e-mail account, it's taking too long to load, sorry"
"Why is it that now that I see books, the categories of books that were previously able to be selected now can't. Not only that, when I searched for books, I got the books, but I couldn't borrow them all. The year of publication, the synopsis and so on are xxx. Even if it's still a problem, why is it taking so long?"
"Sorry, that's all I can give you. Because this application is confusing. Every time I want to borrow a book, I always ask for an email address.... After I give it, I still can't borrow...."
"Increase the number of books so you don't have to wait too long üôè can't enter via FB and email, so re-register again"
Not complete. I'm looking for an old book. There aren't any
Features are not okay
Thanks admin. apk is back to normal
"Now how come it can't be screenshotted, even though it can help if you're tired of typing"
"In my opinion, the latest display has many positive improvements such as not being able to screenshoot and record screens. The display is better than before, but why can't I add a marker and the three dot button in the top right corner when pressed doesn't change anything. The previous view, if you have left the book and then re-entered it, will immediately display the last page read, but in the latest view, it will return to the cover page"
The app is great.
"At first, I thought this app was really helpful, especially for me, who is still a student, I don't need to carry a lot of books, just open the app. But why suddenly it can't be opened and the network keeps timeout, even though the network is smooth and I've refreshed it many times. Maybe it can be improved again, because this app is really helpful and recommended, it's a shame if the app isn't even satisfactory :)"
"Worse yet, ipusnas is getting harder to access even when the network is good. Better to use i jakarta"
"Actually the first time I used the application it was okay, but over time bugs appeared. Such as lost book history, queues, and book loans. Everything's gone. Also can't borrow books. The app still needs updating, the bugs are very very annoying. If there is no progress with a heavy heart I will uninstall this application. Please fix it soon, thank you"
Keep going out. Difficult to borrow and download books. What's the matter? I find it difficult.
Joshhh very helpful
Ô∏è
Yahhahhahahahaha hiyyyyik
"Always love to read in this application. I've tried other applications but for some reason it always comes back here, I'm used to it. Hopefully Ipusnas will get better."
"This application is good, but it often crashes when opened, and the book can't be borrowed, how about this?"
My suggestion while in reading view. Can be equated with google playbook.in order to make the reader comfortable.
"please fix it because the book cannot be downloaded, and please increase the collection of the latest books"
Very helpful
"Please Ipusnas, allow me to take screenshots because it makes it easier to use the book when there is an assignment. So, you can send screenshots to share knowledge. Thank you"
"It's really cool, I'm sorry I just downloaded it, let's like to read!"
Difficult to download
"I'm having trouble logging in. Tried logging in via email but can't. It doesn't work on Facebook either. I think there is a problem with my network, but I try to open another application, it's fine. Please help."
"Really good app, I like it"
"The features are good, the books are getting more complete. Hopefully the app will be updated so it's more comfortable to use"
"Please let me know... Why is my Ipusnas now unable to open A message appears: unable to retrieve data from server & no DSL Please guide, sis, Thank you üôèüôè"
"I'm having a hard time borrowing a book because the email verification didn't reach my email, please help"
"I really like reading at ipunas, it's already free and the collection of books is also large."
"A good breakthrough is that reading a book on a cellphone is very tiring for the eyes, especially up to hundreds of pages, I would suggest that it's better to make the display easier, for the screen background is pale white or ivory so it's comfortable on the eyes."
Cool
"Good, it's good for reading Indonesian while here... Accompanying boredom in the middle of college lessons"
"In the class of a state library, the books are incomplete, for village people to read books is a golden opportunity"
"If you want to download, you have to be a member. How do you become a member?"
"The application is a bit ineffective lately. When it's borrowed when downloaded, it can't be difficult to find references for assignments. Because previously it was very helpful for doing assignments. Especially those who don't have money to buy books. Immediately improve because they really need it thx"
"Admin, the application is good.. only every time I want to borrow a book, I can't because I'm asked for verification... But nothing is entered in my email or Ipusnas contacts... so I can't read"
"Please note that this application has many bugs. Here's what I get: 1) The application often logs out of its own account; 2) after the book is borrowed for the 4th time, the book cannot be downloaded. I circumvented by trying to install ipusnas on my pc and it's the same; 3) notification of the book queue when it is available is often repeated. Even once for notification of the availability of 1 book, I got 4 repeated notifications (yes this is annoying). Those are the 3 most annoying bugs. Apps on PC are the same."
"The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis app is brilliant. When the National Library was inaugurated in Jakarta with its magnificent building, as a local, I was envious. And it turns out that an application has appeared that allows local people to borrow books at the National Center. The collection of books is also beyond expectations, quite complete. Butiiiiii .... the application is still far from good. Loading is slow, it often logs out itself. Bookmarks like to disappear on their own. Hopefully it can be fixed again in the future."
"Sorry had to uninstall. Sorry in advance.. In my opinion, the appearance of the app. this seems boring, monotonous, starting from the color game, font, or dashboard arrangement. Network timeouts happen very often, when downloading books, searching for books, etc., even when used for other apps, it runs smoothly. Still needs a lot of improvement. If this is one of the state facilities for the people, of course the budget allocation will not be small. Thank you"
"Suddenly the application exits, I want to log in, I forget my password and want to reset it, I just get an error, the data is not valid, it says What's up"
"Please fix. I borrowed a book that had been in line for a long time. When you get the book. It's only been 2 days that the book is gone, it's no longer there. Annoyed"
It's a good application. There's also a lot of books.. But why suddenly can't open it?
"Now, the loading takes a long time even though the network is full"
"The application is good, and quite helpful for finding references. But honey, it often comes out just like that... hopefully in the future it will be even better üôè"
"How come I can't log in, I've tried many times"
Ipusnas is very good and if possible there are more books on hadith and history of the prophet and companions
The best!
very useful application for book lovers and literature seekers
"I'm happy to be able to borrow books online like at Ipusnas. The collection is pretty good too. But lately the application has been experiencing an error. After the update, why is it getting harder to borrow and download the book, thanks for the clarification, thank you"
"Istighfar every time you want to download a book. Very difficult. Waited for hours for nothing. I've downloaded 99% of the time, I've started again from 0. Until I uninstalled some applications because I thought maybe it was the memory capacity factor of the cellphone but it didn't work either. Internet signal is also not a problem. Please check again thank youüôè"
"The save bookmark button doesn't work on the Samsung A6, it's inconvenient if you want to read the story, you have to start from the start page. Please fix"
Why can't screenshots of books that have been downloaded?
Very nice
Very good application. Help me while at home.
"So bad guys.... why can't I login?? Even though I have checked the password several times. But still can't login once, it always says wrong password???!!!! Whyyyyy??"
please fix it can't log in via facebook..
"I've installed it twice, but I still can't login, I've tried logging in with Facebook and email, but it still doesn't work. Please help."
the book is not complete
"How come now I can't press the book screen anymore..üò¢üò¢üò¢ Even though I texted it as proof that I had a reference book for my assignment..the problem is where I study when I have an assignment, I have to include the reference book...hopefully the next one can ss again... Ss=screen shoot"
"Unfortunately, Ipunas can't print and download it"
"Cool Indonesia has iPusnas, the collection is quite large, hopefully it can be used well by all Indonesian people in increasing literacy. Just a suggestion if you can add a wishlist or wish list feature, because you often want to borrow books but the loan limit is full. If there is this feature, it will be easy to mark which book you want to read next. Maybe you can add a discussion forum feature related to books and literacy. Thank you iPusnas"
"Cool application, you can read books at home without leaving the house"
"Thank you, it's fine again"
"The comments are not edited. Thank you, min, the National Health Center is operating normally as usual. üôèüôè good luck truss!"
"The app is great and very helpful. The hope is that because there is a limit on borrowing books per day, I think it would be good to show the table of contents of the book so that those of us who want to borrow books can get books that match what we need."
This must be crowded during a pandemic like this. Very helpful to spend time while at home
"Night mode req, read mostly at night if the background is bright white it's not good to read, waiting for the next upgrade"
"After the update, how come it crashes often, and you can't borrow books anymore. Ô∏è"
"I think the iPusnas app is a treasure trove. Because in it there are more than 50 thousand quality books that we can read legally and for free. If it is cashed with the assumption that the price of 1 book is 50 thousand, then the total price of the books in the iPusnas application is 2.5 billion."
Very slow
"When I want to download a book, why does a book not found notification appear?"
Why can't the borrowed book be downloaded... I'm so annoyed
"Are you having problems now? Can't download the book anymore. Not one but all of them, the book cover doesn't appear either"
"A very useful application, server problems please fix it again, sir and please add more new features Thank you.."
"please fix it again every time you borrow a book, the file can't be found"
Asoy
Can't download books so can't read
How come I can't download the book? What's the problem even though my cellphone specifications meet
"Yesterday I started borrowing until I read it smoothly, but now for some reason when I want to download it can't, please fix it immediately. It's normal again"
"Please admin permission. What if in this application the addition of a writing column feature for readers is made. If the writings are good and of good quality, they can be used as archives or made into books. thnks"
"Why is it that every time you want to download or download the e-book so you can read it, it can't be downloaded, right?"
"Sorry, I want to ask, how come after the update I can't even borrow books? It says file is not available. What's the solution?"
"Please fix, why does this application need a book for reference, I can't download it since this afternoonüò≠üò≠üò≠"
"I just tried this application, but every time I want to download a book it always fails because the file is not found. what's the solution?"
"It's been borrowed but can't be downloaded, why?"
"Useful, but often error"
please add the enlarge font feature and dark mode where the paper is also black :((((
"Now it's getting slower, loading the book cover image is taking too long"
"In a good network, applications often cannot download books even though they have entered into a book loan, aka the book is not open. Please fix. Then, why can't screenshots of the contents of the book now? Even though it is very helpful if the screenshot can be used again because if it is on ss it can be saved in the gallery and the account can borrow other books."
"Why is this after the update, how come all the books I want to download have a file not found... This is what my cellphone error is or how confused I am even though the signal is also smooth"
Please fix the application because the server is very slow and often crashes
"Frequent errors, can't be downloaded"
"Please increase the number of books, including learning books, don't reproduce the same old novels, I'm sorry for being rude"
"Alright, after a few errors, it's finally re-opened. So far so good and highly recommended for those who like to read."
Assalamualaikum sis. If the application is not limited to screen capture. In order to make it easier for readers to quote interesting words and perpetuate them. Thank you
why i click download can not download the book?
"After the update, I can't download the book I want to read. Hopefully it will be fixed quickly, I'm used to reading on ipunas, thank you"
"It was good at first but after the update, there are no pictures, the book is opened and it can't be downloaded either. Please fix it again for mutual convenience"
"Why can't I download the book, bro?"
"good morning admin, the book entitled Javanese poetry is eternal poetry, please fix it again, I checked the pages are lacking, there are only odd pages, while there are no even pages. thanks."
good
"Already registered on this apk and registered, can borrow some books, but why is the book I borrowed not downloading lately"
"3 stars for attention, sorry, sir, ma'am. Why is the permissions of such a simple application asking for permission to change system settings? I'm a little selective and aware of privacy issues, so I'm a bit paranoid, hihi."
"Can't download books, Cover all books invisible"
"downloaded several times but it doesn't work, please fix the system."
The download process takes a long time even though the signal is very good. The application is also sometimes difficult to scroll. Hopefully in the future it will be better. Don't want to lose to the more popular online reading application next door.
"Really like these apps. But maybe because there are so many users, the application is slow and can't be downloaded. loading takes too long plus the book collection is still incomplete"
"Please, if this is from the government, it's free to download. It's really hard to have to wait in line first."
"I've borrowed the book but I can download this, why?"
"How do you read it, the pictures are all blank. Still confused"
"Previously I really appreciate the creator of this app. It makes it easy for people who want to share their hobbies or just want to fill the void in their time by accessing Ipusnas. Unfortunately, why is it that after I upgrade this app I can no longer update my profile and all image views including book covers are gone? I've refreshed many times but it's still missing and it's a little difficult for me to determine my next reading target. Any solution?"
Why did it take so long to download
Why can't the book be downloaded? Even though it was borrowed. Please help answer min. Thanks. Greetings literacy
"Very few books are available to read. Old loading screen. The appearance of the application is less attractive. And sometimes, once the registration is complete, the book cannot be downloaded. This makes the reader's interest disappear. PLEASE FIXED !!!"
"Sis, I've been using the app for quite some time. I think it's good. But when it's updated, how come I can't borrow anymore, it's not downloaded. The email and so on have been verified"
Very nice
"Thanks to iPusnas, now I can borrow the book (‰∫∫*¬¥‚àÄÔΩÄ)ÔΩ°*Ôæü+"
"The availability of books is still very incomplete, especially books on science and technology. Please complete again."
"Why is the apk so slow?? I've updated but it can't be opened. I borrowed the book, but when I opened it, I was told to download it again and the book didn't have a cover either. Is the site error again?"
"Dear ipusnas, even though it's been updated, I'm still a book lover, what I often experience is *lags*. So I don't spit to download."
"There is no book that can be read bro, every time I click the download button, there is always a ""FILE NOT FOUND"" notification. ??"
"Every download of the book file is not available, so you can't read even though the internet connection is stable"
"Please admin, if the application is being maintained, please let me know through the application, because I find it difficult to do this. I've borrowed the book but can't even download it, I've deleted the cache and data, restarted my cellphone, I uninstalled it and I reinstalled the app, it still doesn't work. That means it's from the application that is disrupting, please act on my advice. Thank you, 1 STAR IS NOT FOREVER, IF IT HAS BEEN REPAIRED I WILL CHANGE IT TO 5 STARS"
Failed to download the book continuously
"Even though there is no queue, when I want to download it says 'file not found'.... How come it's like that??.. Please enlighten me"
"Sorry, I want to ask, I want to borrow a book when it's downloaded, how come the file can't be found, even though the stock of the book is still there, the application is good, helping generations of reading interest"
It is extraordinary in advancing education and literacy in Indonesia. Hello!
"How come I suddenly have to log in again.. and I want to login, I can't.. I want to change my password, I can't even, the email can't be opened"
"Informative, fast and complete, very helpful at this time, looking for books is not a hassle...thank you"
"The application is good, and thank you because this application really helps me in learning üôèüôèüòáüòáüòä"
Cool collection of books
nice
How do you enlarge the text?
"A little advice, please add a bookmark / favorite book feature so that if we want to read again we can find it easily"
"How come it's hard to screenshot now, even though my summary isn't ready yet"
"Ipusnas can't take screenshots anymore, does it read? Even though I have a book reading account, sometimes I like to screenshot the cover of the book to tell me that I'm currently going to read A or B's book, you see."
"I can't log in even though the internet connection is smooth, I can login to other social media accounts, but I can't login to Ipusnas, it's been an hour, please wait then :("
Very good
Convenient and very useful for adding to my insight
"Now the digital era, the millennial generation, all of them use gadgets to cultivate a reading culture, very easy and practical, they can be read anytime in their spare time. But unfortunately, the digital library / general book application is still difficult to access, there are no book collections, there are still few collections, etc. Don't let the millennial generation have gadgets sophisticated, only the contents of all games"
"Good, keep developing."
"It's good, but I think it's necessary to add a dark mode to the screen when reading to make it cooler when reading at night, so far the dark mode is only the top and bottom, but the writing is still bright (not in dark mode). Baca anak indonesia Re: Maybe I mean like an application for android pdf reader (moon+ reader or predigio) pdf can be turned black"
Applications with difficult logins. The game is even faster than this application. Sorry this is a fact.
"Hello, I just borrowed a book, but when I want to read the book, the Ipusnas application comes out by itself, right? His writing ipusnas has stopped. Please provide a solution, so I'm having a hard time readingüôè"
Very cool. Thank you library. Complete book collection. And there is great hope that the collection of books will be reproduced.. And the quality of service will be maintained... my respect..
good
"I like this application, it's really suitable for those who like to read, in the future hopefully the collection will be added again. Suggestion is to have a request option, so that readers can request books that are not in Ipusnas."
"Very happy to have this application. But please, please improve, there are some books whose writings cannot be enlarged. Makes eyes sore."
Wow
Really good
Good app üòä
Why can't bookmarks be used now?
"Good, maybe the search can be refined again so that what we are looking for can appear according to the category of person or category of book being searched for, because sometimes it doesn't match the keywords written"
Excellent
"This app really helps me who wants to learn grammar, great"
Good for enriching knowledge.
This application is very good but there are some things that I think should be improved such as more books from abroad (translations) and youth genre books
"The app always stops when I want to start reading. I don't know why, and I don't really understand that either. I haven't enjoyed any of the books here, though. It's a shame even though this is a national library. I really hope that in the future I can enjoy books here."
"The book can't be downloaded, 99% of the time it's gone, even though it's just been updated... it's not clear"
"Applications that make it easy to read and a diverse collection of books. However, it is more interesting if we can get book recommendations based on our habit of borrowing books or we can find out which books are often borrowed again in a week."
"The notification has been provided, right in the application, you have to queue again..........how about this?"
Pig app
"Download it if it can be in the background too, bro, so that while waiting for the book to be downloaded, you can see the others"
Where is the read button on the book detail page? Why can't I find it? Thank you
"How do you verify the email, he said to check your inbox but it's been checked and refreshed, it doesn't keep going and makes it difficult to borrow booksüò£"
cant login why huh??? :((
So good
"good, there have been many updates, the writing can be enlarged, but every time the scroll is closed, please make it more comfortable! Thank you"
"Sorry, please fix the registration, there is a column for entering the password, even the two don't match, you can still register. If you typed it wrong, you could have the wrong password"
"Really like it and very helpful. But please, please, add a history feature for books you've read. So if you need more, just look in history. Thanks a lot."
"The interface and navigation features in the application, if they have been renovated, are definitely cooler"
"So far it's been very good. The new books are also cooler and up-to-date. Maybe as an addition, I request a wishlist-like feature for the books we want to read."
"Now you can't take screenshots, can you?"
Very nice
"Suggestion: please add a menu that slides the page quickly, so we don't have to scroll or scroll to the bottom. Thank you"
Now it can be accessed :) Thank you very much
"Min, why is the new version worse than the old version? It's getting harder to read because you have to scroll down, whichever last page you read doesn't save, it's complicated when you have hundreds of pages. It's time to scroll, even though if you use the time to read, how many pages have you got?"
Ok..good..beneficial
"With this application it is very helpful and easy, but the application is further developed because sometimes it still likes errors and cannot open the first page."
ALREADY TRYING TO CONTINUE TO LOGIN CAN'T CAN
"I'm looking for the dream nora robert trilogy novel, but it's not there, huh?"
"scrolling down doesn't change ""the book is just flipped over"
very helpful.
Search Books more easily.
Very useful
Very bad
"A good application for growing interest in reading because there are quite a lot of book collections, perfect for accompanying children during holidays #dirmhaja"
I want to read the novel Hati Suhita. But there doesn't seem to be any
I read this very good book with various titles and useful min.
Excellent
Can't login anymore
"The book is good and complete, but sometimes when it's downloaded, it doesn't work even though it's been downloaded many times"
"Sorry, I can't login"
"Great, keep going iPusnas"
Thank you
Happy birthday..
"Give me 1 star, because I can't register/login using Facebook or email, even though my connection is safe, it's running smoothly, there's no problem, please fix it immediately."
":) the cover is artificial insemination. It's actually about illness, seizures, etc. What do you mean by that :)"
"Hello admin, I hope that the features in the application are equipped with learning again on similar applications that already exist, for example bookmate, anybook, gutenberg. hope also for the appearance and layout will be renovated well. This is a national level library application. Hire a professional and innovative application developer! Greetings Literature! :)"
Best
"Cool, that's a huge collection of books. But if you can keep the user interface updated, so it's perfect. :)"
"still 3 stars my admin as a reader is very helpful if there is a page search feature, so the page number you want to read is easily searched directly without scrolling down. and one more thing, please add a favorite/like menu to make it easier to read book titles and add them to pdf format on google drive.."
"Min force close application, please fix it"
Foreign scientific books and research journals are still lacking
Lots of errors
The application cannot be used.
Very good
Thank you for making an application like this that is capable and tries to advance Indonesian education and foster interest in reading Indonesian people really lose out to Indonesian youth if they don't know and don't want to know about this application Due to their busyness and addiction to playing games Thank you National Library
"The application is very good, but there is something lacking, namely there is no option to read with a dark background or night mode like other reader applications, please the developer if you are willing to upgrade the ipusnas application so that readers can read for a long time, such as WPS office which has this capability , thank you for the feedback, greetings literacy"
Excellent
This application is very useful
Ô∏è
Sorry why when I use this application there is no book that I am looking for?
"The books are quite complete. But please reproduce more of his books, especially books concerning subject matter for students. And please upgrade the appearance to make it more attractive, and keep it simple."
Ipusnas is very helpful in finding literacy
After updating why can't it be opened? :(( It says cannot retrieve data from the server and there is no DLS .. please help
a good
Why is the download process so slow? Not like usual. I've been trying to download several books for days.. But none of them are finished. Please solve
Very helpful if you need materials to do assignments
"I've always loved this apk. But after installing the latest version, it often stops suddenly and information appears that the server and dsn failed to load.. too bad."
Ipusnas is good and very helpful in finding literacy
"Error, can't be opened continuously"
"Sorry, please multiply books for education so that those who read can be happy for reference to assignments from school"
Very useful
"At first I thought wow, that's great, being able to read a book is satisfying, eh, it turns out... I can't do that.. logging in has a lot of problems, how do I fix it??!!"
Very helpful and easy to find books.
"The books are quite complete, I like this application, btw, for those of you who have finished using the book, please return it immediately, because how many times have you wanted to borrow a book, you will always be in the queue, it's annoying there, because when you need it too"
Is there a diamond advertisement book?
The app is very useful
üëç
"It's a bit cool to think about it. Very useful, hopefully we all become very talented citizens. Amen"
"Great, the ebook ebook is very useful. thank you"
"very helpful in finding e-books, especially during a pandemic like this."
Thank you.. very helpful :)
nice
"Thank you, the ebook is very useful while studying at home, continue to update the latest ebook books. Need a book on engineering and geology"
"Indirectly, by reading, I have the courage to speak, my vocabulary in speaking is more varied. Thank you Ipusnas for providing access to free book reading."
"please fix it in terms of REGISTRATION OF PERSONAL DATA / LOGIN. This complaint is not only me, it means that it is clear that the problem is the application, not the user. üôè Please fix it immediately because there are so many users who have trouble logging in, especially in the epidemic season this application is really needed because many offline libraries are closed while schools are still running. No need to ask for an explanation, after all everything is clear"
"What do you mean? I can't read this book anymore, the application just came out. Quickly fix it! If not, I invite everyone to give 1 star."
Alhamdulillah very useful
üëç
"Why does DLS error always occur, what do you mean by that?"
This application is very helpful and very good it really helps me learn
"It's a good app, hopefully in the future it can be even better"
May be useful
Very nice
"The security is questionable, the difference between this app password and the others. Now I can borrow 5 days and 5 books, but that makes the queue for books even longer. Hopefully the number of copies will be increased, especially those who are queuing. The search is strange, it's hard to find books, for example the book you want isn't in the search, try searching through other people's history using following. If it's not there, it's not available yet. almost all of them are pdfs, only a few of which are epub. There's still a lot that can be improved"
"I have the highest appreciation for applications that make it easy to access National Library collections, but please add a usage guide to make it easier for readers"
"Good, great collection of books"
"Very useful. There are many collections of books, a fair way to get free knowledge but still respect the author. Suggestions for using this application: You have to be patient in the queue to read, sometimes the book is not empty or incomplete, but someone borrows it."
It's good.. but the book isn't complete yet.. but it's okay.. I still like it..üòçüòçüòç
I like it.. but I still can't figure out how to enlarge the text because it's too small
The desktop version of Ipusnas is difficult to login now.. Same as Iperpus which has an area like iKalbar..
"For a good reading experience, it's just not dark mode. Hopefully in the future there will be a dark mode feature. When looking for a book there is always a pause, the cover of the book can't be changed immediately, the term is still stuck"
Dark mode not working
"The book collection is still lacking. There is also a suggestion to click 'love' or 'wishlist' so readers don't have to struggle to find out which book they plan to read. Sometimes I've found a book that I want to read, while there are still 3 books in the queue so I put off borrowing it, but then the book I want to read isn't there anymore and looking for it takes time. If you click 'love', you can find it right away and you can borrow it."
"This banged faucet, the qpps continues to add to the collection, bro..."
"I like iPusnas more and more, now I can borrow 5 books a day and the loan period is 5 days."
"Why can't it be screenshot? Duh, even though I really need it"
"This is very useful for reference, the book is also good"
"Very useful, Thank you ipusnas"
"Give three first, yes, so that you can continue to improve yourself. The suggestion for the initial login display is to make it simple like Gmail, so that those who haven't registered are not confused. So the place to login for those who have registered and signed up is not a single form.."
ok
"The book collection is still incomplete, such as the incomplete metopel book, hopefully in the future we can add to the collection of books, especially scientific books for students to make it easier for students if the book they are looking for is not in the local library"
Why can't the fur be screenshot???
"Can't read a book, when you enter the book page, the application immediately exits.. please fix it"
"The display is not attractive, it often lags"
Why is the download process taking so long? Not like usual
"There is an error in the curl paper transition in my application, unlike the previous versions, then sideways or downwards when exiting the book it always returns to the cover"
"Very useful, keep going the Indonesian national library"
"I can't log in using my email, there's a notification for changing my password but I can't open the link, please help"
Assalamualaikum min why am I my number is not registered even though I have registered?
Unknown errors often occur in all application operations
like
"This application is good, but if I want to see my queue list, where is it, I'm looking for the features, it's not there"
"Really good! Increase the reading interest of Indonesians! Suggestions for more novels to translate. Harry Potter doesn't exist. Plus please answer, why are so few copies of books? Example of the Supernova series. The 4th book has 20 copies, but the 6th book only has 2 copies. So queues pile up"
Very helpful for finding references. Really recommended for anyone
"Excellent! Please update the book so that it is more complete and add the option to search for pages so I can skip reading, thank you üôèüèª"
Just try it later if it's good the stars will be added üòä
"It sucks so I can't SS. Like the source of the bibliography for a thesis, even though"
Good app
That's cool üëçüëç
good
"The application is really bad, not clear. I don't want to give a rate but how can I be forced."
The application I love the most and always faithfully accompanies me when I have a lot of tasks and are boring
Very nice
I really love ipusnas...
Very good
"It's a good application, but please fix it for the queue list. Please make it automatically borrowed, min, if the book is already on the queue list. In my opinion, it's better than being in the queue, but instead of having to fight over the book when the notification comes out, it's a shame for those who have queued for a long time but didn't rush to borrow it because they were the last ones in line. So it's not queuing, please, min so the first in line, give me first, if you have beer in stock, there's no story about fighting over books"
"Ipusnas is good. But how come the Android and IOS versions are different in the quality of the book? Sample book of the tragedy of dawn. If on Ipusnas android the error is sticky, it's not easy to read. On IOS, my husband has the normal font, there are no problems and it's easy to read. Fix the ipusnas android."
"really cool, very grateful for this application.. especially when #stayathome is like this, don't forget to enter the horror category, especially Risa Saraswati's work.. hopefully it can be realized"
nice
"Very good, the reference is quite positive"
Why can't I enter?
Add a pen
Love this apk. Lots of knowledge and useful
"There are still bugs that I think are very disturbing for comfortable reading. Especially when choosing a book, the cover of the book does not match the title, even all titles with the same cover are a bit confusing. Please fix it immediately, thank you.... I give a 5 rating because I love this application, it is very useful"
"Why can't I borrow a book? Pdhl I've sent an email verification, but there's no response, please speed up the verification"
Excellent!
"It's too complicated, I've registered but I have to register again, ask for a password, I've included it and it doesn't work, haha"
Okay
"In this apk there are no complete and up-to-date books, so I find it difficult to get references to books in lectures. Sorry, I hope there is a fix in this apk to make it more useful"
Why is there no sign up via a google account? The problem is that I don't have a Facebook account when I register an email account but it fails. Please fix it because this app is very helpful
"It's a shame that the loan is very fast. There hasn't been 24 hours of borrowing, it's not finished reading yet, it's not on the shelf. At least let me know when the deadline is over"
Very nice
"please min. Learning design principles book. By Dewi Salma Prawiradilaga. It's multiplied, min, don't run out of stock, Mulu."
Very good
"I have repeatedly logged in with my email account, but I still can't even though my email and password are correct. Why is it strange that logging in should be made easier especially with the use of an email account."
Easy to use
"This is what makes the application not try first, what can you do. I can't log in. It doesn't load, it doesn't move. ...told to log in. But can't do it. How do you want to read ebooks"
Very helpful for those who like to read books
"Nice apps, really helpful üëç"
"Good application, can read for free...."
"Cool, it can be a bridge for people, especially young people who always hold their gadgets so they can read ebooks. Please improve the developer again for the reader because it's not smooth when scrolling or if it needs to be made like Kindle :)"
"This application is very useful to increase knowledge. We can read useful books for free without going to the national library, although not as much as in the Indonesian National Library"
Glad to have this app. We can read various books. It would be more fun if the application didn't have frequent errors
Crazy crazy with friends
"Seriously crazy. My password was spread on the internet when I checked it on the avast checker. This is a mess, the developer will find out all the passes"
"Why does it take so long to log in using Facebook? Tried to use email but can't. ""Email address is already registered"" even though this is the first time I have downloaded and logged in to this application. Why is the TDK password correct when I login, even though the password is correct?"
Adding a reference
"Cool, there are lots of choices. But I want to ask for books that are out of stock, don't you see it when you search?"
"How is this, how do I register... It's really hard to read, it says the account has been registered but still can't do it"
"It seems that this application still needs to be repaired. The problem is when I want to log in, on my facebook account 'please wait' it takes a very long time. Then when I want to log in to my e-mail, it's the same. It's really hard to click the next button. It's me who is slow or the application is error. Disappointed."
Amazing. I really like this iPusnas application. I can spend some free time reading and don't need the library anymore. If the application is to build a better nation..we support it togetherüëåüëçüëç
Excellent
Very bad security system
Maybe the User Interface can be beautified again and sometimes the application performance is still slow
Quite complete
"Why can't I login? Use a Facebook account, please wait for the writing. Use email, already use the account. How is it?"
"Just downloaded, hopefully the book I'm looking for is here. Come on, read the book in an official place, not an illegal pdf"
"The apk is good, it just needs to be improved about the length of borrowing the book about 5 days. And this app will get better"
"Dear ipusnas admin, please speed up the download speed when you want to download books. It's really slow when you want to download it. If there is a network problem, there is no problem where I stream youtube, the other downloads are fast. But I definitely want to download the book in the app, it's slow, I'm sorry."
"The application is good, but the problem is that it crashes itself, I've downloaded it. Suddenly I was told to download again. Login is the same as logged in. It crashes, finally I log in again. I like the cover of the book, it's not clear, but in the end it goes back to the original cover like it lags. Hopefully it can be fixed. I love it. 3 first. if it's correct 5 stars"
Why are books at Ipusnas difficult to download now? You have to download the book you want to read
"Very nice. But you can only borrow 2 books. It's just that reading the synopsis is good after reading it is boring. If you want to borrow again, you can only have 2 books. Have to wait 1√ó24 hours. Rare history books are not here. .."
Huge collection of books‚ù§Ô∏è
üëçüëçüëç
Make it easier for book readers who want to borrow books from the National Library online

"If you want to find a new published book, for example, about fashion or novels.. it's really hard. I've entered the keyword but sometimes I can't find it... for example, every time I look for a book, a chapter about anything that appears at the top, it must have the same title, please fix it."
I regret downloading it..... The book keeps running out... Waiting in line.... Mulu's email verification... I swear...
"Great app, very helpful. thanks very much"
"thank you, this apk is really useful for me who likes to read. It's also nice to be able to borrow a variety of books, almost all of them are available, hehe, I'm grateful to have met the ipusnas apk."
"Frequent distractions but worth it for a free book reading app. Moreover, there are so many famous books here! That's great."
"The app is good. It's just that I think the format will be the same as the original book. But it turned out to be different. For the novels, please make them exactly the same as the physical books. Better read. The rest is good. Just complete the collection. The example of the novel 5 friends is not complete. The mystery of the coffin 2 by Abdullah Harahap, please. And the Harry Potter series awaited."
"Ipusnas is good because it can make it easier for us to borrow books through the application, I hope the books in Ipusnas are equipped again Thank youüôèüôè"
You can read any book without having to carry a thick book with you. Nice application soroüëç
"Sorry, why is this list of books incomplete, can't you find a historical reference book, Indonesia will not progress, if humans only read fiction and tips & tricks.. Please find the book Catastrophy Worldwide, by Taufik Ismail.."
"Thanks to this application, I can learn about business"
"Useful for those who need literacy for research references. Please expand the collection of Prof.'s books. Jogiyanto, many are in need. Thank you"

"How can I cook, I've searched using a Facebook account, it can't take too long... If there's a problem, it's quickly fixed, it's not left alone like later if others download this application to many who are disappointed, please fix the problem quickly"
"Hello admin, there is a problem with the Curl Paper Transition, please fix it"
"Sorry, please fix the user interface for the PC because I can't find the button to scroll the page and the problem of downloading the book is really slow even though the internet connection at my house is 10 mbps."
"I give 5 stars even though I haven't used the apk, I'm sure this apk is good just by looking at the critical reviews"
"So many I download library applications, only the most stable, develop the application again"
Excellent
Thank you Ipusnas
"If you want to log in using Gmail, you can't do it, it says you have registered your email, when you try to log in, the next button doesn't even come in, you clicked it multiple times, you just don't log in, until you use a new account, it's also not clear, it's difficult to log on"
"Alhamdulillah, this application really helps me in finding references for all my assignments, it's a great application. thank you Ipusnas"
Please multiply new novels
Very helpful for digital book discourse
Thank you for reducing boredom when wfh with useful reading.
Very nice
Why do I always ask for registration when I want to borrow a book even though I have registered my email?
"Not useful, there is no book that can be borrowed"
So it's good to find the reference book...
Really gives my personal experience to be even better.
"This application is very good, it really helps me in finding a reflection of my assignments. There are only a few books that I haven't found."
"Please add the loan period. One week minimum. If you read a thick book, it's difficult for three days. So borrowed many times. Eh, when I want to borrow it, it's out of stock."
"Thank you because with iPusnas I was able to find the book I had been looking for for a long time and I found it easily, cheaply and efficiently."
"The app is good, but it's still flawed. Starting from a less interactive display, slow, lots of bugs. For a national class, moreover, this includes the v&m command, Jk-amen, ""Creating superior human resources for advancing Indonesia through reading"", but the apk is still lame, it doesn't make sense. üôè"
"Thank God, with iPusnas I can keep social distancing, but still be able to run a hobby Thank you for the hard work of all the teams who have kept Ipusnas running, hopefully the collection of books can continue to be complete, by reading the world in our hands"
This application supports learning
"The National Library can now serve digital lending. That is great progress. In fact, at this time, the digital collection is getting more complete by providing popular books that are liked by many people. However, there are still some books that are not yet available in the iPusnas application, especially books that are physically quite thick. In addition, the book borrowing period, which I think is still very short, requires borrowing and re-downloading books."
Thank you very much for helping to find references for teaching materials so that the lessons I convey can be more comprehensive because they are supported from many books.
Gosh this is the app I was looking for
"Sorry, I can't login, bro, it says the email has been registered, I tried using another email until it's repeated 3 times, but it doesn't work."
"Sis, how to register is difficult to load"
The dream app for book lovers. especially original books not pirated. Respect the author by not buying/downloading pirated books or ebooks
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to increase knowledge
VERY RECOMMENDED

"Many popular books are not available yet, hopefully in the future they will be more complete, such as the works of Fiersa Besari, Mark Manson, Pramoedya, thank you"
Why has Ipusnas performance decreased? I can't borrow books anymore. Always say 'Network timeout'. Please fix soon
"When logging in, why can't it?"
"Sorry, I have already installed this application. But can't enter. It's been reinstalled, still the same. Still can't log in."
"Good, I'm really happy. After a long time wanting the school library, this application is finally getting it"
Nice app

Mantapppp
"The application is very useful and very good. But since the update, the download of the book is very long, even though the network is smooth, opening ig yt is running smoothly. Please fix"
"Thank you, very helpful application"
"This WFH time is really suitable to fill your spare time while reading e-books. Especially if we need ideas or references to make books. Usually, we can go to the library to read directly on the spot, because now conditions like this the iPusnas application is really suitable as a place for inspiration and easier access for those who like reading digital books."
This application is very helpful for finding references and highly recommended for people who like to read‚ò∫Ô∏è

I like this virtual lending system. May you read a lot of variety
Looks like the collection is not much... ..Or I'm not good at searching.. ..Please list the books by author.

But unfortunately, I want to give options and suggestions, okay? It's good, please make the system easier, because I've used this apk before, but unfortunately, when I needed it, it took a long time to load. And also now use it again, to try again. Hopefully satisfying for good not for half. Amen. Thank you. Good night."

"I've verified my email but I can't log in, so what can I do, bro."
"The first three stars, right, because there are still many things that need to be improved, one of them is often closed, the book collection is also incomplete and the loan period is too short, only 2 days?! Not enough time to read a book with a lot of pages."
It's fun to add insight
"the application is really goodüòç, the books are many and free, if you can, add more loan time."

ok
"Good application to make it easier to read books. There are several things that need to be fixed so that they can become meaningful inputs hiiiiiii: 1. Incomplete collection of books 2. The application always logs out automatically, so it takes a lot of time. Hope you can still log in as long as you haven't logged out 3. The network system is still not good, even though the signal or network is full 4g but it's always difficult to load the book category"

"The ipusnas application is not like the initial release where in 1 day the borrowed book has been read and wants to be returned then read another book. Now you can't, and you have to wait for the next day, even though as a reader who needs lots of references, it is very difficult if you can only borrow 2 books per day. Please so that the ""return book"" option can be reused, so that you can borrow books again, so that readers can read a lot of other books to find what they want"

Thank you ipusnas!üíô"

Don't be rich before, the application, especially now that students need it, when WFH is like this.... It takes a long time to borrow books, especially if they run out of stock. For those of you who are new to using this application, creating an account is easy, just use email or FB and if you want to find other journals, check the National Library's Instagram, there's a link there"

You could say only a small number of readers can borrow it. More often out of stock. Hopefully it can be used as an evaluation material. But as a supporter of applications made by the nation, I still give 5 stars."
Adding free reading material
"The book is quite complete, please add the borrower's quota. However, the application is very slow, often errors too. Please improve."
"I tried registration but failed, how do I do this?"
"I want to ask, I forgot my password. Then I click forgot password and was told to write down my e-mail account to reset it. Then, why does the link sent by Ipusnas in the e-mail about resetting the password does not want and there is an inscription, one of the writings is Invalid data. Please help, thank you."

"At first it was very difficult to log in, but after a few hours it worked. And hopefully the books with the most queues can be added with copies. üòä"
"Please make more collections... especially library science and literature to fill your spare time... when WFH is like this, it's really fun to read collections from iPusnas. Thank you.."
"With ipusnas we can read as much as we like the latest books, can fill the time when we stay at home"
Very helpful during this pandemic üòç
How come I can't log in
"Why can't I login? Suddenly out of account, when I want to login can't. I find it difficult to access Ipusnas, especially since there are no open libraries due to this pandemic. My network is good to access ipusnas. Please immediately improve the quality of the application. Thank you for helping."
"Sorry in advance. I want to convey my complaint when I first used the ipusnas apk. Why when I click 'borrow' on the book I want to borrow there is always a notification with the words ""You haven't verified your email. Check your inbox or spam box if it hasn't been found or please contact the Ipusnas admin"" I guess"" like that. Please provide it explanation. How to solve it. Thank you. In the meantime, I'll give you 2 stars. Later, I can improve it."
"Please fix the system again :( When you want to borrow books it's always ""served in the maintenance process"" you know right now there's a corona outbreak, you can't get out of kmn2, where to learn from home, tasks pile up. This Ipusnas is not very supportive :( Please those who take care of Ipusnas Don't let it get to the point where you can't borrow books. Please multiply it a day to a maximum of 3, this really can't come out looking for references."
Very useful.. it's a shame.. the book is incomplete and most of the outputs are old
"how come it can't load, how about this?"
"Good, hopefully the collection of books will be more and varied"
"It's hard to register for a network timeout even though the network is good, fix it again"
"I really like it, the book is quite complete and there is a collection of books from outside too, it's often slow but it's okay"
Why is there no book page jump feature so you have to do it manually
"Why can't I log in every time? You can't use Facebook, you can't be asked to wait and it doesn't finish, use a Google account instead it says your Google account has been used to login, even though you've never done this before, what is this?! Please help, I can't read books.."
Annoyed... Even though I was hoping but couldn't log in it's been 2 days
It's easy to help my child's knowledge
I hope it's good because I just downloaded
Very helpful for finding information. With the free feature to access all books it can make it easier for us to read any book
Very helpful
"It is very useful that Ipusnas can read books anywhere every day, without having to carry a lot of books with a smart phone, hopefully in the future it can be better"
I often get downloaded books that are lost when offline and have to download them again
The books are good but unfortunately the borrowing limit is very short
good
"The application is very useful, my friends say, but I can't login myself"
Thank you. Very helpful.
"Excuse me, why am I trying to login over and over again but I can't? I've never had an Ipusnas account before, and I can't login using Facebook either. Solution please"
"I can't login, it's weird, even though the email and password are correct. I've even uninstalled and then downloaded again. still the password is wrong. re-registration. uh the answer is the email has been registered. Log in again with the same email, but it still doesn't say the password is wrong. even though the password can be used by other applications. It's weird when I want to read a book, there's still a problem like this. weak!!"
Still often force close even though the cellphone specs are quite high. Upgrade again min üëç
I can't borrow the book I want because my account can't be logged in.
"Often logs out alone, the forgot password feature is problematic"
Favorite application.
"Love it!! Sometimes if you want to borrow, you have to wait patiently because the number of copies is limited, but that's okay, there are many other titles that you can read while waiting. Please update the collection frequently as many of the newest books are not yet available, including Harry Potter and Andrea Hirata's novels (:"
"This is really good I swear I'm not lying if you don't believe me, just try it yourself"
It's been almost five days I can't log in even though the email and password are correct. please fix again
How come the search results don't match?
Why can't this make a title search anyway?
"Sorry, why can't the search feature be used now. Usually when I enter the author's name or the title of the book it immediately comes out, why not now? This makes it impossible for me to find the reading I need."
Kereeeennnn
"Can't login, have tried many times"
Taek
Why doesn't it work when I download it?
Very helpful :)
üòçüòçüòç
"How come I can't log in, when I click, from now on a notification appears, please allow this permission, when I click OK, I enter the cellphone settings, I don't know what to allow again. Please respond."
"My internet connection is good, but why is it that I can't download books with only 3.2mb in size?, I've been waiting for 1 hour and it still doesn't work"
Can't login with fb and the collection is very lacking
Why can't I login? Pressed the button can't continue
"I just downloaded this app, but why does the app suddenly stop, so I can't read books"
Can't login
"Keep adding to the collection, bro! And keep on fixing it so it doesn't lag if a lot of people use it"
Enough to help make the final project
"I'm just about to download, I hope it's as good as people's reviews"
Very nice
Horas...
"I want to improve my review. I have successfully logged into the application. Thank you for replying to my review, I like the app"
"The books are good, but it's even better if you can read the book without having to borrow the book first. The problem is that if it's a short book, you've finished reading it, at least 1x24 hours you can return it. The maximum limit for borrowing books is only two booksüò•. But the rest is fine. üëç"
"Even after logging in, I can't do it"
"For those of you who like to read, you must download it! I'm very happy because the choices are many! It's a shame the application hasn't been downloaded until a million, even though it's free"
"The UI still doesn't attract attention, and every page that is replaced has a notification, it's very annoying, please improve it in terms of the user interface"
"Hi, how come I can't open it? It keeps failing, it says server error and no dls. what do you mean? please respond min"
"Please add a collection for the novel, Armijn Pane shackles, because this book is one of the important books of the new generation of poets"
the book is not complete
"Thank you, iPusnas is very helpful, especially for me who is doing my final project. But please help, min, for the current conditions (limited by the Covid 19 virus) I find a lot of books that are not available & have to queue, even though I really need the book. Many regional online libraries are still experiencing problems so they cannot be used. So, please provide a solution, for example, increase the stock of books or there is communication with regional online library managers so that they can be immediately activated. üôè"
"Frequent errors, please fix"
"How come I've borrowed a book but there's nothing in it, how come it asks to log in again and again, even though I want to read a book"
"Sorry, why can't I login? I've used both alternatives but it doesn't work at all"
"If you can add more, min, the borrowing limit will be 5 books, if there are only a few, it's a pity that you have a lot of work to do, then please give a notification when the queue of books is our turn, so that people don't take it, okay, thank you"
"Please upgrade the application because there are often errors, so when reading the scroll feature, it's made smooth, because it's stiff when scrolling. Continue to improve the bookmark feature & last page read, so that when you want to read again it doesn't start again from the first page"
Very useful for readers who prefer to use Indonesian references. Hopefully the collection will continue to be added and the borrowing time can be longer. Thank you
Please add book collection :D
"It's good, but the curl paper transition is still a bit weird in my opinion. Please fix."
"It's been a few days I can't download the book even though the signal is good, it just makes me emotional"
cool
Tried logging in many times but still can't
"Very very useful application. Continue to add to your collection of books, okay?"
"Sorry, how come I try to not be able to log in, OK? How do I log in so I can read..."
Why are you always asked to register even though you have already registered?
"Why is this, for registration, the message appears that the email has been registered, but for login it can't continue, I tried using a Facebook account & 2 Google accounts but it still doesn't work Please fix itüôè"
Have you tried many times to download why can't it? It's been a long time just playing around.. Please help. Thank you
"WL. Very useful site. I hope you get the reward. Unfortunately, Mbak Ruwi Meita's book collection is still minimal. It would be great if his works such as The Mystery of the Bee House, Ilse's Shackles, Carmine, The Mystery of the Salt Sculpture, etc. His books address domestic and women's issues which are excellent for sharpening readers' empathy. He is one of the best local thriller writers. Like Natsuo Kirino and Akiyoshi Rikako."
"Can't login via email, why?"
"Very helpful, working together to build Indonesia in terms of more advanced science üòäüòä and waiting for other development applications"
"The apk is good, easy to use, but sometimes the title or author that is entered leads to another title or author, and also the book is expected to be reproduced again but so far Ipusnas can make me able to read books that are in my study activities at home because of the covid-19 pandemic"
"Cool, the level of comfort is growing."
"The collection is more updated, the display is made more attractive, not just looking at one or two colors"
"I want to log in using Facebook, I am told to wait, I use e-mail, it says e-mail has been used, even though this is my first time And I use a different e-mail, it's the same"
Very favourite.
"Ipusnas the best. But sis, just a suggestion.. can you add more cognitive books in terms of consumer behavior or understanding like that üòäüôè"
"My suggestion is to increase the variety of textbooks for various levels. I think there are quite a few books on lecture material, so when looking for a book sometimes it is not available at this National Center. Please further develop it so that this National Center can be a source of reference for younger siblings of students and students. But other than that, I like the look of the app and the ease with which it's easy to borrow and return books. Thank you"
Can books by popular authors be reproduced? And popular translated books too? I want to enrich reading references.
"I don't intend to borrow books... logging in the list is really difficult, I've been waiting all night. Please wait for it to go through fb, it's already registered via email.. disappointed.. I can only see the catalog... can't read it.. it's like an online bookstore"
Lots of psychology books
the app is slow consuming a lot of data
"Honestly, the quality is 3 out of 5 stars. But I just like the application to read books legally."
Why does the app always stop!!! Can not be opened. Even though I want to read
"It's impossible to enter, the password is always wrong, even though it's correct, it's a shame that the national library is like this"
"I'm a new iPusnas user, I want to log in, how come I can't continue via email even though my password is correct?"
Satisfied
"Can't read the book"": how about this?"
Very very very useful...
"Why is it that when I enter my email password it's always wrong, even though it's already correct"
Often force close
"I've tried several times to login but can't. I can't even login using a Facebook account, at the end of the day I wait a long time with the command ""please wait"" for up to an hour I can't wait. I can't use an email account either, trying to log in the end the password doesn't match even though my email account and the password are correct, why is it being wrong, I'm blaming... please fix the system... good intentions, why is it so difficult... for a while I will give this one star"
"How come we can't see another book, if we take the wrong book, we want to return it, we have to wait 24 hours, it must be borrowed at least 2 but the return is free, so if we take the wrong book, we can quickly find another one that suits our needs, please fix the system this doesn't help"
Mantaappp
It's really good that there is a place to read free + legal ebooks even though the collection is not very complete. Hopefully the collection can be expanded in the future
"In the midst of people's minimal interest in reading, this app is good....moreover it's free so anyone can access it...imagine if you pay...you have less interest in reading...paying also seems to be decreasing the literacy rate in Indonesia.. .Thank you"
ok
"Actually I don't like reading books and I prefer watching than reading books but since I saw my ex friend posted on ig so I want to try reading Ipusnas, if it's cool I save it if it's not cool I uninstall"
very helpful for me
Very nice
Very good online reading media. the collection is awesome. Free again. keep bossque
"Every time I open the application, the network goes out, I don't intend to make an application"
"How long is the maintenance, min, why is it taking so long"
Why can't the Ipusnas application be accessed and every time I want to borrow a book I get an error?
"Why is this Ipusnas, why is it so difficult to enter, it's getting errors again and again"
"Can't be accessed continuously, even though I really need it"
"Admin of The Art of Thinking Clearly, why isn't there? Please add the book, thank you ;)"
"disappointing .... it's nice to read suddenly logout yourself, can't log in anymore...."
"Slow, even though the internet network is smooth"
"How come it's so hard to open, why?"
"The application is good, but for borrowing time, please prolong it a little and why do you have to keep logging in even though you are already logged in. My advice is to just login once."
Why the application won't run? Even though the connection is stable.. Disappointed.
very helpful app. but lately it's always getting errors. please fix :))
"Even though sometimes there are still network errors, but with the existence of iPusnas, I feel very grateful that there are other online libraries too"
"I'm logged in, how come I can't continue, how do I do this?? Please don't make it difficult. Come on, support education.. education needs support like ebooks.. especially in the midst of this Qif-19 pandemic"
"Thank you national library, hopefully in the future the book collection will increase and the number of books borrowed per day can be more than two."
"Before the download is complete, I have given 5 stars.... Hopefully there will be a large collection of books"
"Even though I have logged in, why do I always ask to re-login every time I want to borrow a book? Why don't you really want to make an application?"
Cool
Thank you
"Continues to fail to login, even though I have registered, but when I log in, it says the password doesn't match :("
good job
"Hello iPusnas, why can't I login? I'm using fb or email but I can't login, please fix it admin"
"I want to ask you why, after borrowing the book, when you want to read the application, the application continues, please fix it, thank you"
"Hello ipusnas, I want to download the application, but how come it doesn't work? Pdhl I want to borrow the book :("
Cool
"too bad.. several times I want to borrow a book, it always fails, because the email hasn't been verified .. it's weird I don't understand ... was told to check inbox or spam but no notification .. please fix it again"
"When I want to download, why is it taking so long?"
I'm disappointed that I can't borrow the book because the email hasn't been verified....
A place for you to be literate
"I've used this app before. However, because there are other needs on my cellphone that require me to delete some applications on my cellphone, I delete this Ipusnas application. Now, at this time I downloaded the ipusnas application again and why is it so difficult to log in? Even though the email password is correct, but it doesn't work, already using Facebook to login is also difficult. Please clarify. Thank you"

Very helpful
"This application is very helpful, especially for those of us who lack funds to buy the books we want, but we can access them through this application, thank you, the national library"
"The application is very good, it helps us in adding insight. It's just that if we want to use this application, the signal must be strong and stable. Then, if possible, the loan period was extended, because the book I borrowed was not enough if I read it in 3 days. Thank you Please consider, Min..."
"Great, only the loan period must be added"
"This is my first time trying ipusnas, but how come it's disappointing. I just borrowed a book, the app even stopped by itself"
"Thank you :)) very grateful to have found this app, you can read it anywhere at any time, the collection of books is also very large"
Guud
steady
There are not many books available and they are not new. But it's okay.
I use this to give appreciation to the government and the authors of books to advance Indonesia
Upgrade
"Please make more books, so you don't have to queue"
Why can't I login?
"I've tried logging in, how come it doesn't work, why is it that it's been 2 days and it still doesn't work"
Very helpful application to read books online
Excellent
Thanks. So you can read books anywhere and anytime.
"Please increase the stock of the book, don't give a limit for borrowing the book, please"
Want to know what's in it
How come when I borrow a book it crashes?
"Very useful, hopefully the collection will be more complete so that it really becomes a digital literacy reference center"
PLEASE help to login with facebook
I once downloaded iPusnas then I logged out and wanted to log back in but how come it keeps failing? How do I log back in?
Why am I having trouble logging in?
Be a window to the world. Upgrade and add to his book collection.
"Good, when you register and verify your email, the email doesn't come in"
"Alhamdulillah, quite satisfactory. Hopefully there will be no more problems in the future."
"The online version of the book collection is quite complete, although there are still some that don't have an online version"
"Alhamdulillah very useful, complete collection of books.....thank you"
"I give 5 stars, because it really helps when I'm bored."
"Why did I finish drinking yesterday? When I wanted to open the book, I was told to log in again. Now I want to log in, how long does it take?"
Why can't I login...? Already 3 emails have been registered it says but keep trying again
nice
"Why every time I want to read a borrowed book, the application immediately crashes and leaves itself? Please fix it, to make it more comfortable."
Very disappointed that the book was not lent in the order in the queue
"I want to ask, does Ipusnas have to be Android OS 5 and above? Finally... yesterday it was sad that the tab couldn't be used. Now it can again. Thanks Ipusnas üòä"
Not bad for a start
"Thank you, I really like it, hopefully in the future it will be more complete for various translated books"
Why can't all books be borrowed? Even though my internet connection is good
"Hi, I just downloaded the app. Then I want to log in but I can't continue, I want to try to change the password, I can't open the web to change the password. how is that?"
"My account can't borrow books, it says emails are still being sentüòå"
Keysip
"Why nowadays ipusnas often get errors?? When the apk just came out, then I wanted to enter again, suddenly there was no data, reloaded repeatedly even though the signal was good... so I had to uninstall it repeatedly.."
"Edit: why is my Ipusnas so hard to open now? Even though he wanted to borrow a book, he said there was a network error. Even though my signal is fine. Please fix it, I need to borrow a book for an assignmentüôè Very good! Now I can find the book I need via the search button that wasn't there before. Thanks for the creator of this application. I love it. Hopefully it will continue to grow and of course stay wallet-friendly"
"It's really hard to log in even though I'm really happy to try it when I want to log in I can't, please fix it again so it's delicious üôè"
"Still not able to read it, I want to borrow the book but there is no process. How do you do that?"
"Why can't I read the book now, suddenly the application stops, please fix it"
The application can't be opened even though the connection is fast
"Why isn't my book here, man? Are only famous people's books stored in Ipusnas?"
The best application that must have on mobile
Let's see first
"Min, how come I can't login via email"
why can't register? I've tried many times but it still doesn't work
"I want to log in but it often fails, please help to fix my login to facebook"
"When I have to stay at home, Ipusnas gets an error"
hard to log in
"Ipusnas has a network problem, right? How come it can't be opened since this afternoon? Please fix it soon"
Why can't you come in?
Can't open
How come after the update it can't even be opened. Even though this apk is very useful for doing online assignments at home because of the corona pandemic quarantine. Pls fix it tomorrow as soon as possible
Clicking suddenly logs out of the account. Re-entering it took a long time and tried to delete the APK and then install it twice. Still can't log in. Is re-registering a third time? The inconvenience here.
"Ipusnas is having problems, isn't it? how come every time I open it, I always get an error, I'm surprised, even though yesterday it wasn't like that, you know..."
Why can't login
"Sorry, I'm having trouble when I want to register using email. The word ""network timeout"" keeps popping up. Not just a list, when I try to borrow or search for a book category, the word keeps popping up. Please explain about this üôè"
How come mine can't be opened?
"I am currently in Malaysia hoping to be able to read books from Indonesia again online. But the application often responds to Request Timeout. Even though it can smoothly open Youtube. Please upgrade the server, greetings Indonesian readers"
"Can't, enter '-' The error first says:""( Even though the network is fast"
"B1 first..why every time I log in I can't..how can I do it...why everytime I want to log in using email, the password is always wrong.Pdhl the password is correct..pls fix it.."
"I usually don't have too much trouble logging in. It's been failing since the afternoon. I can login using my email account, but when I borrow a book, I can't even get it. Login via fb at all doesn't log in"
When I open it why does it keep getting errors :'(
Very useful üëç
"Why can't I log into this application abroad, can this application only be used on the Indonesian server? please solution.."
I've tried logging in but still can't log in... please help
"Sorry, I can't open the app. There is a notification that the server data does not exist, so the application must be closed"
"Bismillah, this application is very helpful. With many references and the completeness of the existing materials, it is very easy for students who are currently implementing the Online lecture system. The thing I complain about from this application, the ipusnas application often logs out by itself. So that books that have been borrowed disappear from the shelf list. Even when re-login is difficult. Thank you, and sorry."
"Sis, I have a problem logging in, it keeps failing :("
I give a lot of ratings so that the manager of this application is more enthusiastic about fixing the shortcomings in this apk
"I often go out, I want to borrow, I can't even though the signal is strong"
"How come I can't log in? Even though I have created a new email, it still fails"
"I just installed the iPusnas application, but why can't it be opened?üò¢"
"Instead of reading pirated books, it's better to read books at Ipusnas, I really recommend it"
"I can't open it again. Why the books? No DLS, close the app. What does it mean?"
"For this book, there are many, but not complete, and the lack of queue notifications which are sometimes late, so books are often borrowed from other people first. The hope is that the more complete the book and the better looks üëç"
"it's hard to log in. bad connection. what an application, even though the internet network is full, it doesn't lag to open other things. It's overloaded and keeps time out. I don't intend to make the application"
"Hello, iPusnas, I have a question. What's wrong with the application? This morning I could still read easily, then this afternoon when I opened the application it kept stopping by itself, finally I tried to re-install it, until I restarted the cellphone, but it didn't recover, the loan history didn't come out, the loan book didn't come out, the book queue didn't come out either. , please respond immediately, it feels very uncomfortable.."
"Can't be installed, almost half an hour waiting, still can't, even though streaming is smooth"
Why can't I go in to borrow books here...
Failed to enter
"Sis, why can't I login??"
Why is it difficult when I want to register and always time out?
"the application keeps crashing, the book I want to borrow doesn't exist even though it was there before, I clicked on borrow and it goes back again, the error reading continues even though it's been updated, the good network has been stopped using wifi and the error still persists"
"Etdah, it's really taking a long time to load.... It's a shame"
Why do you often go out alone?
Applications are lacking in joss.. always network errors first.. even though the network is fast..
"How come you can't log in? Even though I've used email, it still doesn't work. You can't use Facebook either. Please help"
The book is good. like it.
Hello. please increase security on iPusnas again. especially regarding screen shots. it's an opportunity for irresponsible people. don't want to lose to toon toon
"I've registered 2 times using a gmail account, I've used the forgot password program but when I click on the link it doesn't work. Already registered via fb account, this doesn't work, why is minn tired, I can't register back and forth."
"When logging in, it's really difficult, when you log in, all the books you want are out of stock, so you have to wait a very long time."
"Why can't it be opened?? Having a country is like not having a country. If you don't have a country, that's okay, but this is a country, right? Seriously, if you make an application..."
Please reload ammjnc
Why does it take so long to open this app
"So far it's been very helpful. However, it is even more helpful if the book collection is updated, so if you are looking for more references. Its features are also improved so that more and more people use this application."
"How come I log in but I can't, yha"
"Please fix the application. Just last night I downloaded the book, this morning I logged out myself."
Too heavy. Continuous timeouts. Even though I want to borrow a book to read accompanying #at home
nice
"Why can't I login via Facebook? It's very difficult to log in, maybe it can be used in a simpler and faster way"
Why does it always return to the first login screen? Always come back to continue and start now. What's the solution?
"really appreciate this application, very helpful. I give 5 stars, but the collection is complete again, bro :)"
üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
Rise the cup dude! campaign! It's become best app in my phone this days thx for quarantine
. It's really hard to apply the application.. Just load it then
"A good application, just a suggestion to add a collection of books, because there are still a lot of books (novels in particular) that don't exist, even those books have been in print for a long time, please consider üôè. Best wishes for iPusnas"
How to verify email :'(
"Where can I see if I'm looking for a book, just type the author.... Because sometimes I don't know the title of the book..."
"This app is great. My suggestion is to add a wishlist feature to the books, namely the books you want to read next. And please increase the number of books on ""Self-Development"", because I really like it."
Very helpful..
"This is a Message from the Heart. Very Incomplete Books and References, Complicated Borrowing Activities, Must Queuing Online (lol), Please Make it Easy for National Libraries, ""People who have the intention to read, don't even do it"". He said Indonesia should be more civilized and advance literacy, especially when there is a corona outbreak, when simple things like this don't pay attention to the comfort of Indonesian users/students."
"Sorry, min, I can't login, I can't. I have registered via fb but please wait. So I tried to use the email I registered but the information is that the email has already been used, even though it's my first time using Inpusna. Thank you"
"It's good, but most novels are not like learning, for example, college textbooks, because it's hard for college people to find books online."
How do you read the book? Cook must be stored on the shelf first? Then can't mutually replace it? Cook a day must only read 2? ah
"Very nice. If possible, add books that don't exist yet."
"My suggestion is to provide a menu containing the most widely read books, so that users can more easily find books that many people like."
"How come my email hasn't been verified even though I've tried 2 emails, so I can't borrow books"
"Here's how to borrow it, how come it reads sorry your account hasn't been registered yet"
It's great to add insight to the nation's children
"For those of you who are crazy about reading and don't have capital, this could be your next escape t4"
Good.
Cool
"Please increase the limit of books borrowed per day and please if you return a book, you don't have to wait 1 day because if the wrong book is borrowed and returned, you have to wait 1 day. So I'm asking you to fix it. If it is guaranteed that the National Health Center will be successful. Amen"
"A little advice for the UX, especially on the reading display. We recommend that when the screen orientation is landscape, the display becomes fullscreen. Because the border above the bottom of the screen (which serves as a navigational area) is actually annoying when reading because the reading space on the screen is getting less and less. Thank you~"
Very slow download
thank you very helpful. . .
"It's still hard, sir, it's still difficult to borrow a book, I'm also confused, mass God, I'm confused :("
"Still can't change the password, it says invalid data"
can it be downloaded on a gasi laptop? or only on android?
Very nice
hadeh
"It's good and there are lots of choices, but it's annoying because it's only valid for 3 days... At least the loan should be valid for 2 weeks or 1 week for a popular book..."
The book is incomplete
"So guys, the mechanism for creating an account is like this: In the Login tab, press use email, enter your email and password, there will be a notification if you don't have an account, then you can register. OMG... Sorry, Sis, I just want a suggestion, if possible, the login and registration tabs can be distinguished, because it's confusing."
It seems that Ipusnas has not updated local novels or new translated novels for a long time. I wonder why? Even though it is always awaited but there has also been no addition to the translated novels. Too bad...
good
"hello min! I want to give advice. I feel a bit uncomfortable with copying books at Ipusnas, because many books are important to see in color but are copied in black and white. I read a book about graphic design but it's in black and white so it's not clear in practice. So my advice, please give colors for books that explain a lot of theory with pictures, min. Thank you admins!"
"The more you come here, the more problematic the application is. sometimes out. if you download even though the network is fast, it downloads very old books, even though it used to be very fast."
The app stops by itself. Cannot open books that have been borrowed. Come on. What kind of application is this?
I hope my job is done
"The book collection is very complete. However, in the book EReader, it turns out that there is no feature to bookmark/stabilize the writing of the book, not as described on the iPusnas Help page. The application layout also actually can still be improved because it is too basic."
The application keeps coming out on its own
"It's good, it's just that the loan period is extended please :"" / 1 week / 2 weeks"
"It's ok, but if we stop reading for a day or two, the book we borrowed can be lost, but we can borrow it again."
"Thank you for the book, it's really helpful for those who can't afford to buy a book, hopefully it will continue to grow"
"How come I can't log in to the application, I've tried logging in via email and Facebook, but it still doesn't work even though the application is really good."
"Thank you, this application really helped me in doing my assignment :)"
"Sorry why every time I want to borrow the book, there is still an email verification notification. In the past, when I downloaded the application, I had entered my email and password. Why can't I borrow a book? In my email account there is no command to verify email. I wonder how?"
Very helpful.
"Already verified email, but still can't be used. What's the solution? I have contacted via email but no response at all. Please improve the performance of the admin again."
Can't open
I can't get my queue notification.
Like
Jose
Quite complete and good for reading
"This is why I can't log in, I can't log in, I can't log in using email, they say the password doesn't match even though it's correct, then if I use fb, please wait, it never logs in, even though the signal is loud. Please help, thank you"
"Just a suggestion, the notification from the book that is waiting in the queue can be seen on the cellphone notification"
"Thank God, I am very grateful that this application is very helpful in making assignments that require many references ..."
This application really helps me in my studies.
Thank you for making this application so that it helps me find books easilyü•∞ I hope the collection continues to grow‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
"I'm having trouble, why can't I read when I want to? When entering the password still can't."
"It's free, but it turns out to be very limited in stock. Reference books are sorely lacking, or perhaps only in my field, fields related to language and literature. Please if possible the reference books are reproduced. As a college student, this is very helpfulüôè"
Do I have to have a membership card to be able to access all the books??
Likeüíô
Why is the dark background enabled but still not working???? Ô∏è
I have registered and have a National Library card. But to log in via email and Facebook is very difficult.
"The first time you know there is an iPusnas application, you immediately download it. Until now, the iPusnas application has really helped me in borrowing books. So, if you can't go to the library, you can borrow it here. Hopefully the collection of titles at iPusnas can continue to be added. Ô∏è"
"I'm looking for books related to teaching materials that can even be library materials, right ASU!!!!"
Reasonable
"Very good. It takes more and more complete book categories, quality and quantity."
Nursing books are still lacking :(
"This application is very good, can add insight"
"Just installed, really good... Heaven for nerds. But I'm confused about how to log in... I use a fb account, it always fails, so I can't read and read"
"Why does it take so long to log in, even though the network at my place is good."
Very helpful
"Why can't you login? Is this a useful application or not. Regret downloading it. Like a stupid person, I take care of this application every day."
Less than symbol
"That's great, but can the books be more complete and updated? There are several books that I searched for but they are not in this application"
I hope there will be more books
"An application that really tests patience, lots of bugs, searches don't match, loading a book of 4.3 MB takes 2.5 minutes (even though the Telkomsel 4g+ network)"
"I've entered the account and the pass, when I click next, it doesn't work, there's no response"
"Min, please classify the books by category of reading, author, best seller, etc. Hopefully this application is not easy to come out by itself. More books collection"
"When you want to read, you have to log in, the difficulty is that my Facebook and email accounts are difficult to log in, you write, please wait a long time, please fix it"
Very helpful in studying
"The best place to read free legal books, hopefully the book collection can be multiplied."
Hopefully this digital library will lead me to become an Indonesian Reading Ambassador Aamiin
How long does it take to log in
"Good, improve more cool apps like this :)"
"I swear I used to use iPusnas to log in in 2019, but in 2020 I couldn't log in at all even though it was me I used to be, and I've used a Facebook account and still can't log in, so my passwords are all correct. Please provide a solution, not just saying maybe the password you entered is wrong or your email address is wrong. I need to use iPusnas because my hobby is reading and also to help me do assignments from my lecturers. Please fix the system please. Please read!!!"
I hope the collection of books at ipusnas increases
nice
How to read and borrow the book is not clear
"Nice app. The display can be improved again, and added a night mode for reading to make it more comfortable for readers."
Borrowing is not limited please
"This application is very helpful, but I am having problems, namely every time I want to log in the password I use is always wrong and when I want to set my own words in the email that has been sent to my email address but there is always a problem....please fix it, min..."
good
Very petrified my task.
"I'd like to suggest, try adding a feature like ""wishlist"" or ""to be read"" so when we find a good book on the homepage but don't want to read it at that time, it can also be added to the TBR feature. Another suggestion is to enrich the title of the book and the number of copies. Ah yes, if possible, the books that appear on our veranda are the genres that we like to borrow"
Can't read a book
It would be even better if a dark mode version was madeüëç
"the choice of books is small. must add more,"
This is the top pkok
"This application really helped me in my lectures, considering that the national library was closed for 2 weeks due to Covid-19, hopefully it will pass quickly. I suggest that more digital books be reproduced, especially for the digital books I was looking for were not available, namely the Applied Statistics books from Dr Kadir M.Pd Edition 2 and Edition 3 which I often read in the National Library. Hope it can be developed again Team!ü§ó"
"Just giving one star is useless, I can't log in even though I've downloaded twice"
"The best iPusnas. If you want to read a book and it happens to be out of stock, just read it online, satisfied with borrowing from iPusnas"
"How come it can't be opened even though you're logged in using Facebook, just wait for it to continue. Please confirm, bro"
A very good application for me who likes to read. Many choices of books that can be read for free. In general the application is good. I'm just giving input so that not only the front cover is displayed when choosing a book but also the back cover and if possible the first few pages to be able to give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe contents of the book.
Best
Do you pay for this if you borrow a book?
"In the future, please add the collection and number of books, there is a review before borrowing, the number of borrowings is increased, there are bookmarks or favorite books to be borrowed, there is a search when opening the book like a pdf. Because there is no review before borrowing, so the return of books does not have to wait 1x24 hours and hopefully in the future it can be returned the same day. When searching with what keywords and search results sometimes differ from the expected keywords."
"Assalamualaikum Min, I forgot my password, I tried to reset my password via email, but when I tried to reset the web address, I got an error‚ò∫‚ò∫? How is this, even though the application is good"
Nice slur
"Suggestion, hopefully more novels will be addedüëç"
"Great app, helpful. But it can be improved a little in the completeness of the book."
Please set it to be offline
good apk
"Great application, just found out that there is a free digital library,"
can ipusnas only be installed and accessed from android? can't it be installed on a laptop?
"Now borrowing books to return them have to wait 1x24 hours, it's very inconvenient, because sometimes when you borrow a book it doesn't fit, you can't borrow something else. If that's the case, there should be a book peek feature so you can see what's inside at a glance"
"Honestly, the existence of the ipusnas application on multi-platform makes me love reading, even though the UI/UX still needs to be improved a little but it can be tolerated. Please increase the e-book collection, or provide a pocket-friendly paid subscription feature so that you can increase your ebook collection which is more updated and can also provide mutual benefits to the author. Btw for the desktop version, there are a lot of bugs, please tell me so that the desktop version is updated üôèüôè"
The verification issue has been addressed. Now I can borrow books. The service is fast and very friendly when dealing with problems. Thank you
"Please info, why during the installation process there is a request for access to taking pictures and videos?"
"This application is very helpful considering the price of expensive books, here also provides many books for free, this application is very useful"
"I have downloaded, and have logged in using a fb account or email, but please wait for the reading. It's been a long wait, but it's not. Hu Hu"
Unable to login account. Please hold on. Even though the network is good.!
"I'm sorry, why can't I register from yesterday, I registered using email, I can't register using my Facebook account, I can't either"
"It keeps failing, the password is correct, but the password doesn't match the application, what is it?"
WHY IS THE BOOK NOT COMPLETE? TYPE WHAT TITLE COMES OUT WHAT BOOK. KESELL
It is good and needs to be developed again. Cheers and greetings literacy
"Thank you ipusnas. Even though at the beginning it was difficult to login, now you can. Add to the collection of bestselling books that are radiant with harry potter and twilight. Thank a lot"
Add dark mode or reading mode please
good
"I also have the same, I have downloaded the application but when I log in using email it always appears ""Your password does not match"", even though my email is still active, so I changed my email password, it's still the same, I was the one who got this app shareit from a friend because I couldn't login I finally downloaded it myself, but apparently I still can't login. So how do I get logged in?"
"Apps. ipusnas is very good. But even better, there is a review menu before borrowing. then how to request a book on ipusnas. Maybe it would be better to add a collection such as Kiyosaki, psychology corner, gramed best ten seller... please add the collection with the latest book from mator printing. always success ipusnas"
Can't borrow more than 2 books
"Oh, bro, I already have another one"
Very helpful
okay
"Can't login using Facebook, even though it was fine before. Please update"
"Please help, why am I registering using Facebook, please wait for it üôè"
"Good, can make the door of the world"
"the application is good, but why now can only borrow 1 book a day... really little"
"Thank you, very helpful once again looking for textbooks"
Helpful apps
I am satisfied with this application
Amazing.. very very helpful..
"The collection of reference books is not complete. I want to download this, to look for references for campus assignments, but there's nothing."
Difficult to log in
"Please, this application is not responding for the xiaomi redmi 5 plus cellphone, answering the admin response: sorry, it's still not working, huh. The cache data has been deleted and the application is still not responding when opening the e-book. More replies: frist, break all the rules- Marcus Buckingham, and self driving - Rhenald Kasali"
"Very nice. There are already 50k kinds of books. Please add digital signal processing. Principles, algorithms, and applications as well as Campbell's Biology fifth edition, volumes 1 to 3."
"The application often crashes when I log in, it keeps returning to the home page"
I hope this book will be useful for all readers
ok
Very cool
Often the book can't be updated
"Not satisfied.. the application seems heavy, the text does not fit on the screen so it is difficult to read, the system is borrowed and must be returned (this is not a hard cover). My suggestion is to use ""wattpad"" made in Canada, it's in the play store. there are also complete books in Indonesian and translations .. read satisfied and easy on the fingers."
Ô∏è
"Cool, keep going the world of Indonesian literacyüíï"
I already have an account at ipusnas but why do I install it again every time I want to borrow it says it hasn't been verified after being sent back it still can't even though it has been successfully sent... my help
Please add Harry Potter. There was no such thing as a popular book.
"Please, bro, make a wishlist feature so that the books we want to read can be put there"
"Kerenn Indonesia is also digitally literate üëçüëç I have recommended this application to my lecturers and friends. Hopefully, the problem with the error can be resolved soon"
This application after I downloaded it can't be used when I want to find a book
"I still prefer reading books than playing games, but because all the books have been read... So I want to find an application that can read books... And finally I found this application, immediately downloaded and read a lot of books in this application. I like the book the most with the title ""Nyunyu Study Tour to the Beach"". Very funny!, Cool too!. Thank you...;)"
"I already borrowed the book but when I clicked on the book, I exited the application. Please fix"
Very helpful
"Please fix this app again, I downloaded the book when I opened it and it kept coming out... Time to uninstall...."
"The application is good, but it's better if the book borrowing limit can be increased again"
"For those who have low vision limitations, this application is very good, but it's a shame that there are no settings to enlarge the letters of the text book"
"This application is very good and very helpful if the books in the campus library have been borrowed or cannot be found, but I have a problem, when I have registered and can borrow books, and for several months I have not used this application, and now I use it again, but when logging in it always doesn't work, logging in using facebook for example, it takes a very long time to load, and doesn't log in, please helpüôèüôè thank you"
"Just three first, later if it's good 5"
"Very useful, complete book, can read free books, easy to use and practical. Just a suggestion to add a feature to add books that will be read later, because there is still a limit on borrowing 2 books per day."
"I really like this application, the national library where all the books are of national standard and follow the curriculum"
How come it's hard to log in... The login takes longer
Contains useful and insightful books
"- please extend the time for borrowing books, because there are books that contain up to 300-500 pages - in the future you can consider making ""reading mode"" (the background is darkened) so that you can read comfortably for a long time - more complete books"
really ok
"Why is the writing blurry now, and I can't zoom in"
Can't register
It's hard to enter
"2 books are too few. Reversing 1x24 hours is too long. If it is limited to 2 books, it is better if you can return as much as you want. Because looking for the right reading can't be seen from the cover and title."
"This app is really good. Makes it easier for us to read without having to go anywhere. And after I updated the apk again, it turned out to be even better than before üëçüëç"
"I think the completeness and types of books are very good. But the loan is still lacking, a little advice from me. Please add a copy of the book in order to increase the borrower's quota (reduce the queue quota). Thanks"
Is the application still error? Why can't you borrow a book?
even though there is a login feature via facebook but it can't log in :(
nice
Jose
"Reading seems easy, anywhere and anytime"
"How come it can't be downloaded?? I've tried over and over and still can't do it... please help. No notification appears when the download fails, bro... how about that?"
Can't login and sometimes can't be opened
"I'm still not satisfied because many of the books I want to look for are not available, hopefully in the future more books will be added."
"The iPusnas application now often has errors. Sometimes it says can't retrieve data from the server and no DLS even though the internet is just fine. then when I can log in, I am asked to re-login but I still can't enter, even though the email address & password are correct. Previously, after writing a book review, there was an error, I couldn't read a book that had been borrowed, couldn't find a book. It's like there's no connection, but again my internet is fine, open another apk that uses the internet"
"How are you? Every time I open a mental book, I keep going. If you don't open the one you borrow, it's not mental. Even though the RAM is big, the memory is big."
It's great to be able to read so many books here
Ipusnas admin please send me email verification I asked for it but it wasn't sent please send email verification please
"Previously I have downloaded, but how come I always can't borrow books? Ô∏è"
Very good application and very helpful
not good
I want to borrow a book but why can't I? Even though I've logged in via email
"This app is good. Help to get quality reading easily and quickly. However, the choice of books in the field of Oceanography and Oceanography is still very lacking. Please consider adding readings in that field. Thank you. Forward the world of Indonesian literacy!"
Very good
There are pictures and writing that are not clear. And this happens in the diagram image which is very important as a reference ... please in the future so that the images and writings on the diagram can be read in more detail as well.
Very helpful for finding references to work on thesis
"Well, if there is an error, it will be corrected immediately. But this country is really cool for this. Supporting the nation's children to add insight and start realizing it for a more advanced Indonesia. Jaya Indonesia!!! Because Indonesia needs children who are broad-minded."
"It's difficult for dogs to borrow books. If you don't intend to borrow, you don't have to make an application, all foster dogs, you bastard dick application, wild boars, bastards"
Like to go out alone
"How do I verify my email, even though I've opened my email for registration but still can't borrow"
Good apps
Very helpful
useful
This is very good especially those who are looking for various types of books i likeüëçüëçü§óü§óü§ó‚ò∫
"Sorry, I can't borrow the book"
"My advice is to increase the number of rare books, which are hard to find, but this is ok, really, just need to add rare novels"
"At first I couldn't verify my email and back and forth I checked my inbox and the spam still wasn't there. Then I sent an email to the admin, and the admin was fast in responding and very helpful. Thank youüôèüèª"
just try it.
"Good, so it's easy if you want to read books, novels or look for references, but just a suggestion when the download process sometimes you have to start again if there is a network problem or leave the application for a while, please fix it again so that the download process continues and doesn't start from the beginning in case of disturbance"
How to verify the email
"The ad reads a free book anywhere, in fact it's complicated to ask forgiveness"
Always update new booksüëçüëå
later
Cool
"I really like it this is very helpful for people who really like to read, no need to bring books, we can only access them on their cellphones"
"The book is incomplete, especially Christian books,"
"Great,,, so you can read books anytime and anywhere"
"The application is good, if I may add a list of my reading books, then book history and reading pages, and add it to my reading list, such as Wattpad. Then the reading list of books is incomplete, such as knowledge, textbooks, health, literature, etc. Not as complete as the building"
"It used to be allowed to return books in a short span of time. Currently, it must be at least 1 day before it can be returned. It is not a problem. But you should be given a menu to access the table of contents, so that the borrower does not regret that when he borrowed the book he intended was not what he wanted. Or give the freedom to return it, after all, if the book is not as expected, the reader will not read it either. thanks"
When will Ipusnas be repaired? Very slow..
"how come I open it using email even though the password is correct, how come it still doesn't work, ask for clarification, bro"
"I really like it, I hope tomorrow there will be more books on radio science so that radio media doesn't run out of time"
Please fix the bug why can't I login please
"Great, add it. The number of books borrowed"
"Hallo kaa, thank you for the participation of all parties who made this apk, a little I hope that there will be rules for the size of the note I'm tired of having to zoom slide zoom slide hehehe"
Why does my application like to ask for login even though it didn't before?
"Really like this application, so it's free to read. But it would be nice if given to read a few pages of a book, so that when you can decide which book to borrow. Because borrowing books is limited to 2 per day. If you can add to 3 books per day"
"Greetings Literacy, I have no problem borrowing books, limited to 2 pieces. please don't be limited to the book return period, you have to wait 1x24 hours. because: -there are users who are able to read quickly (can finish reading up to 4 books in a day) - often users get wrong or do not find references/reading materials from books that have been borrowed so they want to immediately look for other books. Please help change the policy. Thank you"
"How do you verify your email? because every time I want to borrow there is always a failed message, please verify the email Even though I've logged-in"
good
"There are still many things that need to be added and developed, such as the options in the Google Books application, they should be added, right?"
"Please let me report, I've logged in to ipusnas.. However, someone tried to break into my email, finally I changed my password and now it's safe. When I log back in, how come Ipusnas doesn't work, right? The password is still wrong.. Please respond and help immediately üôèüôè"
"Like there is an Ipusnas, novels that can't be bought can be read for free here. But I'm still confused, for example, if you read until page 200, then continue at another time, it opens from the start page again. How can I open page 200 directly. Tired of manually opening each sheet from the beginning again. Please give an explanation."
"it's hard to update, downloading updates takes a long time, while if you don't update you can't log in and read books"
Very cool Indonesia
Makes us free to read
Can't login
LK
Make it easy for fairy tales to children
"Thank you for presenting this ebook app, hopefully it can educate the nation"
"I like to broaden my horizons. Moreover, I am still learning the language independently. Without help from others. Thank you for the app"
Hopefully in the future there will be more collections of books.
very helpful
nice
"It's really good, thank you Ipusnas, now reading is running smoothly here, so it's even more fun to read. Suggestion for developers, could you add the feature to change pages with the volume buttons, so that you can read using a headset like that for convenience. Because sometimes my hands get sore when I scroll too much when the book is thick, hehe. Love ipusnas ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Very useful
great
"With this application, it is very valuable for us book lovers who are far from bookstores and libraries. Thank you Mr. Jokowi and Mr. Amin, pioneers of the advancement of Indonesian human resources‚ù§"

"Just want to try it, hope it's satisfying"
"How do you borrow, just borrow, how do you read the book, ask for verification of email terms"
"Thank you IPusnas, so I can read my favorite Tere Liye novel... I hope IPusnas can develop even more and the book is even more TOP, Gomawo (thank you) IPusnasüëçüèªIt's getting more and more developed...Aminnn"
Can you add a read feature? So that we can read on the go
"hello sis. I really like this app, but can I suggest it? You can return it anytime like before, bro, you don't have to wait 1x24 hours :( because sometimes the book doesn't meet our expectations. Can there be a wishlist feature? It's easy if you want to read a book, but don't want to read it right then, bro. Thanks!"
"Cool, simple, useful"
Hope it helps <3
Even better if there is a dark mode when reading. Make reading more comfortable.
"This app helps me find citations for assignments. But if I may suggest, please give some kind of book page at least up to the table of contents as a sample. Because there is a minimum one day book return limit, I find it difficult if the books I have already borrowed don't have the material I'm looking for. Thank you (¬¥,,‚Ä¢œâ‚Ä¢,,)„Éé~‚ô°"
Reasonable
Since yesterday I can't login. Both login to Facebook and gmail address
"Please add the book, hehehe... Just a suggestion, maybe it can be added to search for keywords in the book you're reading... If you want to find a certain sentence, it's a bit difficult because it doesn't exist, maybe you can add a voice typing system so you don't have to take a long time to type the title of the book long ..... this application is very helpful for students who are making thesis/reports that need sources from books. Thank you"
"I have invited my students to download this application. With the hope that our children, the nation's young generation will be more literate and continue to develop through a culture of literacy. And Alhamdulillah, the response from the children was very good, even though it started from reading a novel. God willing, if the children are already fond of reading, hopefully they will like to read scientific books and books that are useful for life and the environment. Amen. I thank you very much for all parties of this application. May I continue to advance. Amen"
Why can only borrow 2 books now?
"Good books, I like it. If you want to buy it, how do you do it?"
Jazakumullahu khair
"I've updated, but still can't login. The solution?"
"Why do I change my cellphone and then download this apk, how come I can't login using fb. Previously could"
"It is equipped with a collection of books, especially translated novels. Just a suggestion, what if the borrowing time is adjusted to the number of pages of the book"
"Borrowing time limit, please extend"
"Applications that are suitable for finding free e-books without paying üëç. In addition, it makes it easier to do college assignments that happen to use book references. I have been using this application for a long time as an assignment, and reading a book. Besides that, the admin response is good. Here is a good book. It's just that the search is more towards the name of the author, let me find the book from the name of the author. I hope that in the future Ipusnas will become the best e-book application for Indonesia üëç."
Cool
Nice app. If you can add offline mode so you can read books anywhere without the need to be connected to the internet directly
"the application is really good, very helpful, especially for those who like to read, the loan is free, there are no ads, so it doesn't bother you"
Very nice
"So far the app is fine and fine. Maybe a little suggestion to add the ""List of books to read"" feature because sometimes I find interesting books but on the shelves there are already books that are being read. This feature may be useful for other users. Hopefully the application gets better. Thank you"
Do you have to pay to read books in this application?
When I wanted to borrow a book... there I was asked to verify my email. But I don't know how the cranya is..? Please help ya...
"sorry, this is how to borrow the book, how come you can't? How to verify it?"
"How come I've tried to enter my email several times, can't it? When confirming the code, it says the data is invalid. How are you?"
iPusnas provides a relaxing reading experience both online and offline. Thank you National Library.
"Hello. I'm a new user of the ipusnas app. When I want to read a book that I've borrowed, why does it suddenly come out of the app? It's annoying. It's really important though. Please fix it."
"I like it, it happens that at my house the library is quite far away so it's not difficult to have this application"
Well
Really good
How to borrow at ipusnas? Email verification keeps failing
"The application often crashes, suddenly exits by itself. The book has also been borrowed but can't be downloaded. Even though the network is also good."
"I've been using the ipusnas app for a long time. I used to really like it because it really helped add reference books to assignments. But over time the application often errors. It's really hard to borrow books. The download takes a long time, sometimes it gets errors, sometimes it's already downloaded but can't be opened/read. It wasn't like that before. Please fix the application immediately"
Very useful. It's cool
üòç
"Please for Ipusnas, download speed is always slow. The download period for the 12 MB file is just half an hour waiting. If the reason is because Ipusnas is free, it's better to pay a monthly subscription fee as long as the download speed is normal instead of like this."
Thank you for resetting my password
"How is this email verification not coming in. I can't borrow a book, please help, min???"
"How come it's hard to log in, please fix it again"
Extraordinary..!!!
Very helpful
"The application is very helpful, but when I want to borrow, it always error, I'm confused what's wrong, please help, Ipusnas developer, Thank you"
"Ipusnas is an application that is suitable for Missqueen (like me), who want to buy physical/digital books but don't have the money (I really do), but unfortunately it's still not complete, especially for books that have a series but are in series 2, and the previous series no, it's not only that for books that can be called ""popular"" when the stock runs out, even though if you look at it, the time for borrowing it has passed and it hasn't been returned :""( , well, I hope the Ipusnas books can be stocked."
Can't borrow books from ipusnas.. Error keeps going..
I like it Many benefits
good
Bagua
How come it took me so long to log in with an account
Help in getting sources and increase scientific insight
"I registered yesterday, but why hasn't my account been verified? So I deleted the application, hmm, I can't borrow books anyway... even though I want to read free booksüòÜüòÜ"
"Very helpful and helpful to find references for free. However, there are still many problems with this app, such as downloaded books sometimes not showing up and having to be refreshed many times."
Why can't I open a book that has been borrowed? Why does the app always come back
Not updating
"Please add a bookmark or wishlist feature, thx. Please, before logging in, add the registration feature so you don't have to worry about creating an account"
"During verification, I've checked the email, it's not there, I sent it again, I checked the email, it's still not there. I clicked help even the application stopped. How do I complain?"
Quick response
"Please, improve the quality of the application again. the display is not neat and attractive, often logs out alone, and often lags. I ask that the quality of this application be considered. If you want superior human resources, provide access to information that is interesting and easy to use, disappointing."
"Yesterday I logged in, I can even read books. But today I can't log in, have to log in again. Please give priority to the convenience of the reader, if this is the case, I'm too lazy to read. I have to keep logging in. Please fix it, so that all readers are comfortable."
"Apps. what is useful, I shouldn't buy this book, I will return it, just move it here, the money can be used for something else, buy packages especially hahaha so I can move books continuously"
not complete. rarely find the book you are looking for
Beneficial
"Great, can help users in finding the latest books. Please upgrade the latest published book y."
"I have logged in to this account but after logging in but still I can't log in and it reads that you have not verified your email account, even though I have everything, please help and improve. so much"
"Pressing the borrow button takes a long time to respond, most of the books don't load or the fingers are too big"
"Sis, I'm a new user, I tried to verify the email and it failed and the writing was invalid, how about that?"
This is what I was looking for... Very useful. This really cures my longing to read useful books. Thanks
Ask for the book to be reproduced and completed.... Because the book I'm looking for doesn't exist...
cool...
Read quality books easily anywhere Thanks IPusnas‚ò∫
"This application is very helpful, my advice, add more books for more, it would be nice if you could read books without having to borrow them, and you can return books at any time. Sometimes the app can't be opened."
It's okay... But the books are multiplying again... And new books are published
Why isn't the email verification in my email and how is it admin?
"Greetings Literature. I have been using IPusnas for a long time, and really feel the benefits. But sometimes I have to re-login to the beginning why yes? In the past, my status was a newbie after re-logining my status badge but why now it's back to a newbie again."
"Good....but it would be better if the limit for borrowing books was made a lot, for example 5-10 books. And return of books can be direct, without waiting 1x24 hours. Too long......"
Excellent
Doesn't want to run on samsung tab s2. Directly directed to the device settings. Even though there are no restrictions on the S2 tab. Please fix it again
thank you very much ipusnas..thank you for the quality and empowering books..üëçüëçüëç
"Assalamualaikum, sorry, I want to ask how, every time you want to borrow a book there is a notification ""You haven't verified your email. Check your inbox or spam box if it hasn't been found or please contact the Ipusnas admin"""
"quite a complete collection of books, very helpful"
"The book collection is complete, but please add a 3D view like the original kindle and moon reader. And also please add a collection of Stephen King's novels.."
Thank you iPusnas.
"The application is still not good in terms of appearance, convenience, performance, and stability BUT you can borrow and read good and useful books for free and legally, there is no competition."
"How's the realme earbuds giveaway from the Instagram quiz? From September last year until now it's already 2020, I haven't received the prize. The professional one!"
Want to but it's hard to register time
"great!!! I hope you add to the complete collection of books, thank you"
"Good application, maybe in the future you can add a list of ""next books to read"" which might be useful for friends who don't like too many books on the shelves because they immediately borrow/download a lot of books :) And hopefully the user interface can be even better, thank you"
"I'm sorry, why if I search for the book I can't find it. Even though I've seen it recommended but forgot it hasn't been downloaded, when I searched it wasn't there."
"Sorry, why can't I borrow a book when I want to borrow it? The application asked for verification, but no email was received. I wonder how? Thank you"
"Sorry.. why can't I borrow a book? It always says ""You haven't verified your email"". Explanation please?"
Very helpful for those who like to read.. loveüíï
"good afternoon. Sorry to ask before. Why is there no verification code sent to my email? I have tried many times, but still no result. I even made two accounts, and still no verification code was sent to my email"
"Alhamdulillah, usually someone to be able to read a book has to buy hundreds of thousands of rupiah. But with Ipusnas, we can read many books for free. Thank you Ipusnas. üòäüòäüòä"
Really useful
"I just installed this application, before I borrow I have to verify my email, right? But the email hasn't arrived yet. What to do?"
I didn't get a verification email. Then how can I borrow books from Ipusnas?
"Maybe this application is very helpful. However, I don't think I can benefit from this application because of the email verification that never came. I've checked my email many times and haven't sent the verification email. Please fix it again"
Cool
"Sorry, I have registered, have confirmed my password and have joined as a member but until now I CAN'T BORROW A BOOK, is there a procedure that I haven't done yet? Every time I want to borrow, it definitely says ""email hasn't been verified"" even though I've even registered twice with DIFFERENT email accounts.... I REQUEST ENLIGHTENMENT Please, for the sake of my KTI Thank you in advance GREETINGS LITERATURE ((If I didn't install ))üòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòí"
"why can't I borrow, email verification can't work even though the email and password are correct"
"Hello admin, I'm a new user of the iPusnas app. When I wanted to borrow a book, I was directed to verify it via email. However, until now, I have not received an email from iPusnas. I've checked the inbox or spam, it's still not there. Please help, Min. Thank youüôÉ"
"Hi, I'm sorry in advance. How do you register your email?"
"I like this apk, but why haven't I received an email for verification, even though I've checked my incoming contacts and spam"
How come I can't verify my email? Pdhl already logged in
"So far it has been good, because it has minimized people from buying pirated books. Only for popular books, please update again. Thank you"
"This is it,, no 1"
"Sorry, sis, I want to ask, my email verification doesn't appear even though I've tried many times, how do you do it?"
"Why is this, how come when I want to login using Facebook it always fails. Please wait, it's been more than a few minutes without success to login. Please help"
Can't open... Stuck when asking for permission to open the system
"The system is really complicated, if there is a loan system for everything, even though it's digital, the maximum is 2 days, it's bad..."
"I really like this application, there are only a few suggestions to make it more comfortable: - There are books that appear on the front page, but when they are deliberately searched through the search field, they are not found. - Please add a feature to make it easier to find words/page numbers in the book you're reading, so you don't have to keep scrolling. The TOC is also not always there. Thank you üôè"
"Hello literacy!!! I really appreciate this apk, but I suggest improving its performance and facilities, for example on the collection tab so that the books that appear are recommended books according to what readers have read and on the Ipusnas tab I suggest it is better to replace them, for example we can follow publishers so that when there is New books that are coming for those who follow can read them, and please update the latest books more quickly, so that more Indonesians can use them."
"I used to borrow directly and I could return it. Now limited to a day for returns. In fact, usually more than three books a day are read. Hmm not as good as before. I'm sorry for those who are used to fast reading :("
"Why am I borrowing a book, how come the writing is cut into pieces? jump jump like that"
Can't log in using fb
Great for increasing literacy without going anywhere üëç
"Very helpful, easy and practical to learn any knowledge needed"
"It still needs a lot of development, hopefully people's interest in reading at a productive age will be higher."
"Good, just a little slow to enter registration."
"Most of the books are old books, please update with other new books hehe overall it's really good"
Mother earth productsüëçüëç
Very helpful
"Sorry to admin, why am I logging in using Gmail, I can't log in even though the password is correct? How is this? is there an error' in the application? Please admin to be informed. Plus when I try to go through a Facebook account, it still doesn't work. How about admins?"
"Cannot be used when you have borrowed a book, force close it directly"
"I want to ask how to return the book that has been borrowed, how do you do it?"
"Good, but unfortunately the loan time is too short"
It is very helpful to read books digitally. Thank you ipusnas!
How to register ipusnas
really cool
Very helpful in getting books that are not in our school library
"I got a lot of knowledge in this application, thank you ipusnas"
iPusnas makes it easy for us to read in our spare time.
Extraordinary. My insight has been given to Aufklarung
Help
"Sorry in advance, for the application to confuse readers about email verification sometimes it can and doesn't, And I don't understand Click the spam box and Click the inbox, please admin"
"Why does every time I want to read the book, the application automatically closes / exits, right?"
Nice and good
Very helpful Thank you
Good and fun
Very helpful when looking for reference sources ‚ù§Ô∏è
The book collection is incomplete and also takes too long to download the book. The loan period is too short. Please update the app again
"Thank God the application is very helpful, hopefully we can add more stock copies for the books that are most in demand, and hopefully they will continue to be better.. Amen"
"Very good! Unfortunately, there is no wishlist feature, so sometimes I find a good book.. I keep forgetting the title, because it is limited to 2 books every day. Hopefully the future will be even better!"
"Add your favorite ‚ù§Ô∏è feature, bro.."
Very helpful to read the book that is needed
"I'm disappointed that Ipusnas wants to log in, it's really difficult to tell me to wait but I don't log in"""
"Beloved Ipusnas... I tried to type in the author's name... in the past, that's what I often did, then there was a list of books with various titles with the same author's name popping up why now I can't do it anymore... please advise. Thank you very much in advance... cool for Ipusnas"
why do you want to read a book that has been borrowed and close by yourself?
hard to apply
THANK YOU....LOVE YOU
"Original, Error continues."
really ok
good
Very helpful
"I'm very disappointed with ipusnas now. Even though the email and password are correct, it still doesn't work. If you're confused, just delete this apk. It's like it's useless Even though it used to be delicious"
"Sorry to ask, I have borrowed the book and it is there, then how long does the loan period last? And can I borrow the book after the loan period is over, the song that I borrowed before???? please respond"
"Hello iPusnas! It's a shame, now iPusnas can only borrow 2 books per day. And it can only be returned after 24 hours. Prefer the old one, you can borrow 3 books per day, and when it's finished you can return it and borrow a new one. If you borrow a serial picbook, it only takes 5 minutes to read and I can continue the next series. Except for books of 400 pages and above, borrowing is also repeated. üòä Please change the policy again. It's a big loss just borrowing and reading 2 books per day."
"Min, please make an essay by Mr. Pramoedya Ananta Toer, Please"
"Very helpful, I can read wherever and whenever I want"
good good good
"Hello ipusnas admin, why is it so hard for me to login to the ipusnas application. I've tried logging in via Facebook and email but it keeps loading."
"The application is normal again, and can be accessed, but please include some books from other authors, min. I also have Faisal Ondang who arrived before leaving hehehhehe, thank you"
a maximum of 2 books and a minimum of 24 hours of borrowing is really annoying
"Good, just still not satisfying when reading the e-book. But so far ipusnas is very useful and very useful. For those who want to read free and easy books, you can go through the Ipusnas application. Greetings literacy!"
"Why can't my account login, please, bro, please?"
"This application is very helpful in developing Indonesian reading interest which has been packaged in the form of a Digital Library. However, it still needs improvement in terms of features and application performance. Thank you, literacy greetings!"
very helpful and makes it easier for those who lack funds to buy books
Why isn't this borrowed?
This app is good and interesting. It's a shame the borrowing of books per day is limited to only 2 books. So I can't read any other interesting books.
"Please, users are given freedom regarding the amount of the loan and the time to return the book"
Very cool
Easy to use and free
Thank you for serving well
The application is good üëç too bad there are not many books. Please a lot üôè
Very delicious. Especially when you put it on when you're in a hurry.üòÇüòÇü§£
"Hello! Thank you for providing an application to read books for free. I am very helpful with this application. But I find it a little difficult because there are no features such as 'wishlist or want to read' even though the number of loan books is limited every day. Sometimes when I find a book that I think is interesting and I want to read, I forget it because there is no such feature, only sharing and recommendations. Please improve again. Thank you :)"
"why i give 4 stars and not 5? even though I like this application....because perfection belongs only to Allah. you have to be grateful, even if it's only 4 stars."
üëçüëç
"It's really funny, I want to read and I'm in a queue, it's better if the Anybooks app is freer"
"To the developer, please increase the number of books and limit or limit the borrowing of the books, if possible 6 books that can be borrowed in 1 day in order to go to a smarter Indonesia"
"Thank you, sir. Hopefully it makes me even more excited to read"
Good. Why did it take so long to download the app
"Cool eyes, mak joss"
"It's hard to login, gosh, it says the password is wrong, even though it's clear that it's the password, think again if you want to use this application"
"This application is really weird, why can't I download it... Then every time I open the book, it's really annoying"
Why don't you enter the application even though it's already 100%
Can you add more to your collection?
"It's complicated to just borrow using a lot of verification. Useless apps. To mind, just delete this app"
Add references and best apps for us in the area
the application crashes frequently.
Incredible benefits
"Wow, the application really really helps me who is lazy to go to the library for thesis üòç"
"Sorry, just downloaded, how to borrow, how do you have to enter the code??? I'm confused sis"
not helpful but burdensome
"Actually with Ipusnas this is good, but the server still often crashes or gets bugs like that. Please fix it. Thank you"
The application can't be used...it's logged back to the beginning again
"Lots of books, and all free. Cm maybe if it's like a ""best seller"" book, you have to wait a long time because there are quite a lot of people borrowed, so we have to queue. And in my opinion, the book collection is complete and very diverse."
Why can't I receive email?
"A very good application, because of this application I can read books even though I can't buy them.."
"Add a page search icon when opening a book, it's hard to scroll to the destination too far."
ok
"I often get an error when I open the book, the application immediately comes out on its own and then please add more books"
Why is the email verification not sent to my email????
"Why is it that when I want to borrow it fails, well, I've looked at the spam in the email, there's no notification there"
"If you have any questions, do you have to write them here? I can't send it to the email. I want to ask, I installed this on a PC, because I'm still a newbie, there's something I accidentally posted in the comments. So how do I delete my comment? Because I can't find a way. Twitter accounts can't be DMed either. Please respond and help. Thank you."
"Makes it easier for me to get books that are not yet in Sorong. Cool, hopefully in the future there will be more books that are of higher quality and can be loaned out"
"Thank God, go forward my country üòä"
"Thank you, very helpful in getting book references. Hopefully the application continues to grow and there are other innovations to attract people's reading interest üëç"
"I've downloaded the latest version of ipusnas for PC, but I can't login with the information that I have to download the latest version of ipusnas. Please follow up. Thank you"
"Oh my god it's so useless downloading can't read the books, all books... EVERYTHING... Just started reading the first time eh, I can't enter email..., I've entered 7 different e-mails still can't work, the writing error occurs... WHAT ERRORS BANGKEEE, I WOULD LIKE TO READ YOUR BOOK... PLIS FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO INSTALL THIS APPLICATION... DON'T... FROM HAPPY WASTING QUOTAS... PLIS DON'T... USE IT... BENEERR IT'S USEFUL... SIGNED.. MY STUPID MYSELF BECOME A VICTIM OF MY STUPIDITY"
"Sometimes it's an error, why?"
Less complete
Why can't I login? To read all his books?
It's been fixed... Hopefully it will run smoothly in the future.. Thank you
"Thank God there is an i-Pusnas so you can read books anywhere. Add more collections, yes...if you can include rare collections and old books because they are usually used as references for those who are still in school/college. Thanks"
Good Spirit
"It's good, it's just that the books need to be supplemented"
"Very useful for young people in particular, for a better generation"
"My suggestion, Sis, make a wishlist of the reading lists that you want to read, I think this is very important... Because there is a book that I want to save for when I want to read it. Cook has to borrow first, after all, the borrow list is also limited"
Thank God the app is working fine.
"That's great! But the book I was looking for took a long time to be published, right, like the minor kpmet, when was it on the Ipusnas?"
Excellent
Cool
Very helpful
It's good to complete the health and innovation book again
Cool
"A little admin advice: the information at the bottom of the book is added to the number of pages of the book, to make it easier when before borrowing you open it so you can spend reading it"
"Thank you, Developers. Ipusnas is very useful as a place to find assignment references. If I may suggest, please the limit for borrowing books per day is not only two, üôèüôèüôè."
"failed to download (which is said to be an average of a thousand embe many times) eh, the quota has run out for a hundred only by scrolling on the homepage üí•. For genres, when finished, click back, scroll again. The search only has one cr (no alphabet, the author wasn't clicked, but it's clearly given a color). Adding to that, there's an Adult item that was clearly banned (not only in Indonesia, though) it passed ( yaknowwho). It worked, bc even the cm settings were open to the page n night mode on the sidelines .....or maybe it's for the thick, slack-spirited uncle < hiPNS"
"I think it's better to add features that can make reading easier and also improve the appearance too, I'm sure after updating it will be betterüëçüëçüëç"
"Sorry, the book is not complete"
"Min.. how about it.. even though I have registered, but when I want to borrow a book, there is always a notification that I haven't registered"
Ô∏è
"Good application. So you can read books anywhere. But please, yes, I often read when I suddenly came out by myself. And you can't even open the app at all. Even though opening another application there is no problem. But the app is really useful. Well, it's just that it often goes out on its own. Please, if you want to return the book, don't wait 24 hours. For example, if you borrow the wrong book, you can't borrow another book."
Really good
Good very helpful
Yesterday there was always an error... Every time I opened the book I immediately got an error so I decided to delete the application and re-download it.. Thank God it can be used like before.
Cool
Very good ebook collection
Very nice
Strongly supports the enlightenment of Indonesian people.
Best
"Very useful for the community, especially the student community, hopefully it will always develop and develop amen"
But you can't change books in a day
"Sorry, min, in my opinion, the borrowing of the book is too small and the time period is only 3 days. In my opinion, the book borrowing will be added to the way it used to be and also the validity period will be increased to a week . Greetings Literacyüëç"
"I appreciate this application, this application can make it easier for students to get reading books so that it is easier to add knowledge as a provision in the future, I recommend all students from Sabang to Merauke to use this application :)"
Needs a lot of improvement
Very nice
Please multiply the books. Thank you
Provide a word class book in Indonesian by Harimurti Kridalaksana. Thank you
Makes it easier to find books :) Very useful

"Sorry for the development team, this application still has many bugs, please fix it again for the convenience of our readers. This application every time I log in always out again. And it's been happening for these two days, please fix it soon"
"It's good, for easy book search. It's just that the book is not complete"
"Ipusnas Mantaapp...it's running smoothly now, read anywhere anytime without limits....thank you Ipusnas for useful books...üôè"
Thank you Ipusnas
"I've downloaded it, but if you want to borrow a book there must be ""enter password""/join into an e-library. Ask for your input, how do you do it!"
"The application is really good..but if you make a wishlist it will be even better ..because you can only borrow 2 books a day..so when you look at the good books, you can save them first."
National but very limited books
"Why can't I borrow it yet?, it says the email hasn't been verified, I've asked for cream 3 times but it hasn't been sent to the email yet, it's been checked, it's not in the inbox or the spam box, the email hasn't been sent yet, but it hasn't been sent yet. thanks"
Load app
It's nice to be able to read cool books for free.
Very nice
"How is this, the error has been updated, but it doesn't work"
Can't open it when it's downloaded
"Can't login, is there still an error?"
"The app used to be good. But why suddenly when loading suddenly can't retrieve data from the server and there is no DSL. 3 stars first, later if it has been fixed it will be added"
Can not be opened
"Min please. The loan period is 7 days, because 3 days is a short time for a book with a lot of sheets. Thanks"
"Ipusnas is having trouble again, isn't it??? Even though I want to borrow a book. Why do you keep interrupting?"
Why every time after borrowing an error huh? It says unknown error. It's really disappointing if it keeps happening like that
Apk lags unclear tai
Make your phone lag
"Alhamdulillah... The application is great, there are lots of religious books, and there are also many books to help in learning the lack of one collection for the novels is still incomplete, I'm looking for a novel by Alvin Syahrin, there isn't any but so far I like it, hopefully In the future, the collection of books can be added Thank you iPusnas"
Why can't it be opened
"The network is good but it's a shame the application takes so long to respond, sometimes it can't open, the readings are network disturbances/network problems even though other applications are fine"
Error why can't I borrow it. Logout can't even log in anymore. I have a friend too
Can't login and it takes a long time to load
"Just a suggestion, because iPusnas can only borrow books per day 2, please add a 'read later' feature so that books that you want to read but can't download because the rest of the day's borrowing has run out, can be read/downloaded later. Thank you."
"Why can't I login to ipusnas? Even though I've downloaded it several times, it still doesn't work, it says the server or DLS is wrong.."
Mntulll
"Sorry, min, why after the update. When I read, I like to go out alone . The title of the book is a practical guide to prayer, is it true that we pray?"
"Sometimes it's hard to download, or the book isn't available"
"Sometimes the application comes out on its own, the books provided also need to be updated, but everything is good and very helpful for us who like to read books."
"This educative application should always be given improvement and always be improved... because I myself still find bugs such as force close applications, and can't be downloaded"
very good
"Sorry in advance, why, when I want to borrow a book, am I asked to register and enter a password? Even though I didn't receive any email from Ipusnas..."
I can to read with simple
good interesting
"Very useful, makes it easier for me to read the book... Thank you!!!"
Free. Thousands of books. User friendly. Easy to install. Can communicate with other readers or give comments. Hopefully more interest in reading Indonesia will grow with this kind of application
"when opening the book, it even exits itself from the application. so can't read"
"Can't download the book, when clicking the direct download command auto forceclose"
WHY ALWAYS READ THE BOOK IN PERIBET EVERYTHING BEFORE CLICKING VERIFICATION TPI ALWAYS CAN'T CAN'T
Have you been able to login on your laptop yet?
good
Why can't I download the book? There's always a notification that the file can't be downloaded?
"Min, how do I verify email? Why can't I borrow a book? even though the password is correct"
"After exiting the apk. When you want to read again why do you have to download again. It's been like that three times. Even though the book has been downloaded before. The title of the book is ""win against yourself"""
"I can't verify, nothing comes in my e-mail"
can't open
"Please add to the collection of philosophy books, min."
Why can't the link to activate the account sent in the email be opened? Please way out
"It's pretty good, but I'm still having a hard time finding a certain button... Then when we registered, we were given an email, OK... I checked and it wasn't there, it turned out that my friend was in spam, that's a pain"
Is it true that every Saturday and Sunday the server is down due to holidays? every day access must be slow
National Ipusnas. Can't do anything. Can't enter. Ipusnas dog.
I love reading
"Why haven't I received a confirmation email yet?? Every time I want to borrow, I can't. There is an article that you haven't confirmed your email.. then it says send again, didn't click but my email has not yet received an email from Ipusnas for email confirmation.. it even says ""please contact the ipusnas admin"" how about that. Even though I really need to read the book for my final assignment."
Very helpful for students when looking for credible book references
I have downloaded the ipusnas application but when I want to borrow the book. Always can't. It always says you haven't verified your email. Even though I've tried it several times. Even using a different email but the notification still appears that I haven't verified the email. Please solve.
"Thank God the repairs have been completed.. Sir, if you can, all repairs can be done as soon as possible, sir, because when you need to read a book and the application crashes, it's sad.. Thank you sir for the improvement, hopefully it can be even better"
"What application doesn't help at all, but I want to educate the nation but the collection of books is only novels that are not well known, ouch, uninstall it, okay?"
"The network error has been going on for a long time, even though the connection is fast, it's a shame it can't when you need it"
It's a pity if you want to read you have to borrow it first while the number of loans is limited
It's hard to log in and needs to be fixed again
"Thank you, the apk is very useful, it's simpler, there's no word buy 2, everything is free....üëçüëçüëç Seek knowledge, you don't have to use money"
"Thank you Developers. Ipusnas can now be accessed smoothly hurray!!!!!! I'm glad. In the future, hopefully Ipusnas will be even better and have more cool features. Oh yes, if you can, the book can be borrowed and returned on the same day, please Developer so that you can read more actively."
Never
"still can't login. I used to be able to log in using my fb account and now when I log in again it just appears ""please wait"""
good
It's hard to choose a book
"There is no verification code from my email, min. Please make the list easier. Just from a google play account"
"Good evening Ipusnas I can't borrow books because there's always a notification that I haven't verified my email... even though before I entered Ipusnas, I verified my email. Thank you"
"Three stars first, min, there is no search keyword in the borrowed digital book. Too bad huh??"
Please add the feature to open the book PER PAGE so I can jump to page 124 of 56 (for example). So it's not just a list of contents
"How come the PC version still doesn't work? The maintenance process is long, isn't it? Even though previously it was very comfortable to use Ipusnas."
Make reading activities fun with a complete collection...thank you ipusnas
"Cool, I just knew there was something like this. Thanks government :)"
"I didn't get a verification email so I can't borrow books, please respondüôèüôè"
I'm having trouble verifying how bro
"I got the activation email but when I clicked on the error, then when I wanted to borrow a book I was told to activate the account"
"Admin, for the borrowing days and the number of borrowed books, please reconsider. The number of days is too short and the number of book items that can be borrowed is very little, 2 books. Haven't finished reading, have to re-download. Thanks"
"Suggestion. Please give a review of the book, at least to the table of contents, so that readers can know what the book contains. Because if you don't have one, it will be difficult to borrow another book when you borrow the wrong one, because you are only given 2x a day when you borrow a book. If the book is wrong for the reader, like it or not, you have to wait 1 day first if you want to see the other book. Please give the book a review."
"What's wrong with this application, every time I borrow a book, there is always a written warning that has not been verified, please service it again, anyone who knows the solution, about my problem. If there's no way out, I'll delete this app right now."
"Regis is difficult, please fix it"
Useful. Bestsellers are also available.
"The book is pretty good, the application is also good, but what I don't like about the application is that the book borrowing is limited to only 2. After that I can't borrow anymore, even though 2 books have been read. Please don't limit it anymore, if it's limited it doesn't matter as long as it's a maximum of 10 books a day. Then the book can be returned freely so that you can borrow a new one again."
"Good, but the book is still incomplete, min. It's really hard for me to find a book about medical records :("
"I find it very difficult to register, can you help me?"
"Hello developers, how come my phone on the Oppo A5s doesn't want to run the application? Thanks"
The writing hasn't been verified by mass email.. How is that going?
"Frequent errors', please fix it. Back and forth log in. Borrow hard"
"Complete field of knowledge, very good."
Why does it take so long to enter the application
"Excuse me admin, I apologize in advance for email notifications, please clarify so that people who are opening iPusnas for the first time can be comfortable in enjoying the iPusnas features, thank you so much, I'm sorry min"
"If possible, the memory of borrowed books is stored on the SD card. So users with small cellphone memory are more helpful like that"
"It's pretty good, maybe we can add a book feature that is added by month."
"incredibly helpful üëç able to facilitate the enthusiasm of the readers, but when it was downloaded an error occurred and the data was difficult to find so it was difficult to access, please improve the ease of service again because this application is very useful ..."
"It's been installed three times and still can't be opened. Words that appear, can't retrieve data..."
"When you promise an application to read books anywhere, you can't just enter the server. I can't even login, the verification email doesn't exist either. SRIUS WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE APP? Only frills use national. tae"
Frequent errors
"Yesterday it was able to open but now ""unable to retrieve data from server and no DLS"" I'm confused what should I do to open it"

"Why does every time I want to open a borrowed book, ""iPusnas always stop""?"
"Sorry in advance, I really give 5 stars because I appreciate this application was created for all, but there is a correction that I must convey because it relates to the convenience of the user in using this application. The obstacles when using this application are as follows: 1. Login Using FB can't, it only says ""Please wait...."" 2. You can't login using email either, when you click ""borrow a book"" we have to verify the email so that the email doesn't have a message.."
"What does email verification mean? How come when I want to borrow 1 book, I have to verify my email first... Ipusnas, please answer!"
Hopefully the collection of books will be more and more

"Yes, thank you very much Ipusnas, for the service and friendliness in responding to reader complaints. Hopefully this application is more advanced and quality. Greetings Literature."
It's been 1 mg can't open the app
There are many novels
"It's pretty good, but please, the max to borrow can be about 4 books, not 2 books, I need it for my final college assignment"
"A useful application for users.. A little suggestion, sorry for the admin.. Can the loan limit not be extended? Because this is related to effectiveness for readers, so readers need more time to read the whole book or at least be able to finish some important parts of the book."
"Very useful, if you can borrow 7 days"
"The application is very useful. However, please fix it again because when the application is being used sometimes it often exits by itself. If you have entered, there is an unknown error so you cannot see the book. When you choose a book to read, the application immediately exits by itself. Please respond. Thank you"
ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿß ÿß ... May it be better in the future..
"Why when I want to open a book that has been downloaded, why do I force close it? Please fix it soon. Learning innovation and technology book, digital engineering book"

Thank you very much for the service I give 5 stars for this application

Sorry.. I had to reduce the branches. Problem can't login. Please fix. Or maybe this is because of the new Ministry of Education and Culture policy. Please explain.
"Disappointed, since the update while reading the book suddenly stopped"
There is no error in the application anymore
"Why borrow books max. only 2 books? While there is no review and only a brief synopsis of the selected book is listed, please add more book borrowing and shorten the book return time"
"For application developers, please clarify the font color in the selection of the book category (before choosing a category)..because the text and the background are almost the same, the text becomes blurry and makes it difficult to choose a category. Hopefully it can be considered and can be used as input for the future. and also please multiply the existing collection, thank you ;)"
"Why is it on my Ipusnas application, if I want to open a borrowed book, the application can exit itself?"
"Thank you I Pusnas for running well again. Thanks to the admin. If I may suggest, maybe if possible, the admin can add a book about 1. Development of a tourist village. Anything related to tourism. Thank you"

However, lately Ipusnas has been loading for a very long time, it's difficult to access, I even had time to re-install the application but as a result the application couldn't even be opened at all.

Following technical guidance
"Well, the error continues, is it tea? can't download the books."
"Assalamu'alaikum,, How come the application after being updated is silent, please help"
"I reduced the star because lately iPusnas has often been disappointing. For days I couldn't read because of an error. The book I have borrowed cannot be opened. Anyway, error. Even though my network is okay. Do I have to update every time there is an update? Not too bad, but I just don't like it the more it's updated, the more disappointing it usually is."
It often takes a long time to load
"I don't know if this is good, because I just downloaded it.. But. Hopefully satisfying, because I need a lot of insight"
"In the past, this application was easy to use and didn't have a lot of bugs, it wasn't too complicated. But now it's changed, it's starting to get complicated, even trying to log in keeps failing. Hopefully it's fixed quickly. Sorry, this is just a criticism and suggestion"
"hello ipusnas... how come the return of books must be limited to 1x24 hours??? So what if you've finished reading the book in a day or not? Don't you want to read something else... so the limit for borrowing books is only 2, right? cmon ipusnas...thank you in advance"
"Why does the error keep me uninstalling and then installing again and changing the account to return to normal, please fix it againüôè"
"There are still bugs, can't borrow books"
"The application is good.. I often borrow here. But why now if I borrow a book, it will come out of the app later?? please"
Why is it so hard to log in now there is an error :(
This app is amazing
"An unpleasant bug occurred. Always fail to open because there is no network and no DLS found. I've used both data and wifi that have been filled with quota, but the error is still there. It's been uninstalled and then installed again, deleted data and cache, still doesn't work. Please fix."
"Just downloaded, it can't be opened. How about trying, I'm already annoyed"
"Actually, the application is very useful, unfortunately there are often errors, it's useless to borrow books but can't read them. Please improve the quality"
Beneficial
"There are so many errors, even though it's been downloaded many times.... How do you solve this?"
"It's been 3 days I haven't opened the ipusnas apk but when I just opened it there was an error, I couldn't retrieve data from the server and there was no dls, I closed the application and I tried to try again but I still can't try to delete the data and I open the application again, it still doesn't work can I continue to update and I can't log in again"
"Why can't I log in, instead it says an error has occurred and can't be accessed without DLS. Oh, this gym."
"When I open the book details, it always takes a long time to load and eventually the network timeouts, even though the book has been borrowed and downloaded, but it doesn't appear on the bookshelf. Please fix it again soon."
"Hello! I want to ask, why is it that when I open the application there is a notification ""unable to retrieve data from server and no DLS"". Why is that? And how to solve it. Thank you"
"""Connect error' please check your connection."" The first word I get when I open this app, gives me a bad impression. What's wrong? Even though the WiFi signal is smooth, the 4g network is still good, it's made to open other applications okay... But on ipusnas? Pfft- Okay, I hope in the future to fix this kind of problem again. 2 stars first, if it's fixed I'll edit it later."
"The bookmark has been fixed. Thank you. But the curl paper transition is still stuck. . Please fix the bug, after I updated there was a bug I used curl paper transition, it stuck, didn't go back to the next page Then I bookmarked it, when I clicked on the bookmarked page number, it went back to the start page Please fix it again"
Why can't I access this app?
This application sometimes doesn't work because of a bug...... Please fix it again
"As an irt with 3 children, those who have limited time go to the library or bookstore, with Ipusnas you can read books easily"
Excellent. Make literature..
"Every time you want to open a book, you have to say ""unable to load book details, something wrong with connection"". Even though to open other social media applications smoothly, you can watch streaming videos too. Tried again to open the book that you want to borrow, the sentence came out again. I wonder why?"
"Why is it that after downloading, when I open the server, it doesn't connect?"
Good app! But please do maintenance often because the application often crashes
The error continues to be unable to retrieve data from the server and there is no DLS it says
Apk can't be opened
It's great
"How come it's been installed but can't be opened, why? The text can't retrieve data from the server, that's why, what can I do?"
good bro
ipusnas error againüò≠üò≠üò≠even though it's really recommended.
"Strange, the error is not clear"
"Bad worst bad bad, can't open the error"
Can't open
Can read for free a large collection of books
Can not enter. Error
"Hello admins. I can't login because I forgot my password. I've used the forgot password feature but no messages come to my email. I've done it many times and still nothing. Please give the solution, Ipusnas admin, because it's been months I can't use this application. Greetings literacy"
Error mulu tai
"Yes, the borrowing and return policy has changed, before being updated, you could borrow up to 3 books and return was not limited by time, now you can only borrow 2 books and the return time must be 1x24 hours. So, if you finish reading the book within 2 hours and want to return it, you can't have to wait 1x24 hours. He said the national library was online but limited to active readers and didn't take long to finish reading. Please review the policy!"
"I can't use it, I don't know why I can't retrieve data from the server and there's no DLS...."
"There is a problem opening the application, is the application being repaired/error?"
:( getting worse
Why can't you come in? Always fail at the start. Why is that?
It's hard to do
"With this application, it really helped me in completing various college assignments. Thank you iPUSNAS"
"Very good app, always something new to know. Suggestions for borrowing books, please add because I finished reading so I can't read anything else. And even better if the account status upgrade determines the number of books that can be borrowed . Thank you in advance"
Kh GBPH bodycon Zu hp boho hi Vic
Take a long time to return the book
Sorry to ask. There is not yet a bookmark for reading books.
ok
"My advice is only one, immediately add a collection of books. Keep the spirit in developing this useful applicationüòç I'm waiting for the latest book update"
Very helpful
"How are you cooking, I've registered when I want to borrow, it says my email isn't registered yet, tell me to look in the inbox but there's no further info"
"Very good, and helpful in finding references, but please add more books regarding early childhood education"
"It's good bro, just add more bro. The number of book loans in a day :) or provide a feature to see the table of contents before borrowing :) eheheheh"
Great and very helpful.. please continue to expand the collection of books..
"I'm already logged in but there's another member login. What does that mean, please help"
Hopefully this Ipusnas will be helped
Can help in finding information
Great
"This app is good and very helpful but there are still some books which are not available on ipusnas. If you can, please increase the collection of books"
Kei
Still not enough books
"I really want to like reading, I don't just like buying it"
"Very helpful application, thank you iPusnas"
"The server is good, but please don't have problems when loading the book"
no comment
"Great soul, lots of ebook collections"
How come I can't download the book?
"Recommended download, it's very useful and help everyone to read the best book, also free"
good
Email can't be verified and I can't borrow books even though I'm already logged in and there's no verification code in the email or spam inbox either
"The books are quite complete, but there are some books that I was looking for and they weren't on Ipusnas. Like the Harry Potter novels by J.K. Rowling"
"The search results are not optimal, sometimes they do not display all the book titles according to the query when the book actually exists. ePub format crash on some devices. The social features can be improved again, as long as there are no likes and photo status features, maybe the direction can still be controlled as expected. There is no add to queue option yet. Maybe you can think about a subscription feature for a longer loan duration, but keep the free one so that everyone can reach it."
Nice
Very useful in educating the nation's children. Very good application
Beneficial
Application is very Helpful.
"The limit for borrowing books a day is at least 2 books. In the past, you could have 3 books a day but why is it now decreasing? And now the daily borrowing limit is only 1 book.."
I have downloaded and registered. But can't borrow books. the instructions say you have to verify email first. But no email from Ipusnas has come in yet
"Sorry admin, I can't borrow books, has my email not been verified? Please help"
nice
"Cool iPusnas, a great breakthrough to be able to use gadgets. Suggestion: The dark background feature turns out to be only at the top and bottom, it doesn't contain anything. Please provide a dark mode feature so that it is comfortable to read without glare."
"But, still such a policy cannot be equated with the real world, mas. Is such an analogy quite logical?. In the library (reality) of course we can read first or review a book before borrowing the book. Because don't we borrow books because we find a topic that we are really looking for. Here's a causal scheme of how someone ends up borrowing a book."
Very helpful.... üòçüòçüòç
"I've downloaded the app, I've logged in with email too. But when I want to borrow a book, why hasn't the email been verified? I want to ask, how do you verify the email so you can borrow books normally?"
Indonesia is proud of literacy
"I just downloaded this application. But I can't verify my email.. Open the spam from Ipusnas to click the verification button, but it doesn't work. Why? Because I can't borrow"
"Highly recommended for those who can't go to conventional libraries (with reasons: lazy, far, etc.), but like to read without having to carry books everywhere. Suggestions: - Add a dark mode feature (so it's cool if you want to read the night before sleep ) - Increase the font size (if possibleüôè)"
"When you check the spam, why is there an error when you press verification"
"It can be opened, Alhamdulillaah üòçüòçüòç Thank you very much, Min. Hopefully the application continues to improve every day. Thank you very much too because this application helps us a lot for those of us who like to read books but are constrained by budget problems"
"Incredibly, very contemporary, very sophisticated breakthrough Ipusnas"
Thank God it helps
Best
Very helpful in assignments

"How do you verify the email? It's been entered in the spam email but when I click on the verification email, how come it doesn't load right away? Admin please help"
"Sis, why hasn't my email been verified? There's already a message from the email but every time I click verify it doesn't work, sis.. so how do you do the verification?"
Good for filling free time
"I can't borrow books, I don't understand this application, even though it's good to have this application, it's actually bad inside. Yes indeed. Those who want to download it better don't, I'm also very sorry."
The book is incomplete
"The library in my house is delicious and comfortable, European economy and efficient for high flexibility from effective efficient this is a tool that humans use in the real world My fiance and I know the living room and I'm not surprised and don't know coffee maybe one of them why I don't know Wallahu'alam, at the house of another friend of mine who is already in Indonesia in the future for examples and I also don't have anyone who knows the video link and I'm not surprised that it's okay..."

"How come I can't borrow books, even though I'm logged in"
"Verify the email isn't in your inbox, how many times have you tried it, how can you read it, please, how do you do it?"
Thank you very much for helping me in the thesis process
"It's hard to log in, even though the password is correct"
Well
Excellent
"I can't verify why? So I can't borrow, please help"
"After updating, the iPusnas application could not run. Sad. After the latest update, it turned out to be back to normal. WL."
"Why can't you borrow it?? He said he was told to verify the email, after clicking verify in the email it couldn't. Until it's refreshed many times, it's still the same. Please develop the system again. Thank you"
It's time to learn anywhere and anytime. Through its useful and educational applications.
"Why can't I borrow a book, yes, every time I want to borrow, it doesn't verify, it says even though email verification isn't in the cream"
Excellent
Why can't the application be opened?
"Dear. Admin, I downloaded a book called Gegaran Sinau, Javanese Basa Memetri Basa Jawi volume 2, how come it's empty, please fix it. Thank you."
"Great app, really helpful üëç"
This application makes it easy to find references
why can't it be used
"Min, why is there no email verification, so I can't borrow the book."
Top markotop
Very nice

"Even though I've logged in, but when I want to borrow a book, the email isn't verified"
"Min, how do I verify? Hard to verify..."

"I really like the app, so it saves money hehehehe"
Please improve more. Because the app often crashes. Even though my fav is because I can read a lot of books.
"I live on the coast, to get a good book it is quite far, with this application, it is very helpful"
It's so hard to log in
It's easier in the learning process...I like it
Cool
Okay
"It's difficult to register even though the internet is smooth, there is no email reply even though it's been 3 days. I don't know if it's me who doesn't understand or it's the application that has a problem, please help I want to read but can't. Thank you"
great
"Keep the spirit of Ipusnas, hopefully there will be more and more new and updated literature so that our society can add to their reading or literacy."
Continue to develop and add to his economic philosophy books and accounting books
good
Excellent
nice
Adding book references in doing assignments
Why does my account always ask for verification even though I have entered the correct email but it still fails to borrow
good
Why can't the book be returned right away?
Top
Cool. I'm not tired of going to the local library anymore.
"Often weird. Ipusnas is reducing the number of books borrowed per day. Sometimes he can borrow 2 books. It's not uncommon to only be able to borrow 1 book. For collections, I am grateful because Ipusnas provides many genres that I like. Please return seeortinduki, can borrow 3 per day. Because sometimes the books that have been borrowed don't fit and when you want to borrow again you can't. Thank you"
Excellent
good job
Very nice......
This is what I'm looking for to improve reading literacy... Great.. Thank you
Hopefully in the future the book can be downloaded.
"I've registered but when I want to read a book it always says ""You haven't verified your email"" even though there's no notification in my email and how do I contact the Ipusnas admin"
Really good
Hopefully the loan will be extended
Since I read here a lot of knowledge that I can. Hopefully in the future it will be more complete.
"Min, I'm asking for help, please... Every time I borrow a book, I can't even though I have verified my email..."
Satisfying
"Thank you Ipusnas, I'm very happy because I can read books for free üòç and it doesn't have to be a library or book store if you can add features (read later) please.. because sometimes I find a book I want to read but the book loan has reached the loan limit if you check later I have forgotten and lost.."
want to be smart
"Good, but add a book called Tere Liye, Comet Minor, right? I want to read there isn't any"
If you can keep updating the book
"Sis, I just downloaded the ipusnas application, sis to borrow the book I have to verify the password sent to my email but I didn't receive any email from ipusnas,, so I can't borrow the book even though I want to quickly read the book,,"
"Very useful application, thank you ipusnas"
Educate
"if possible, add sports books, especially about sports tests and measurements"
Completely good
"If only there was a ""favorite book"" feature to make it easier to find again. Or bookmark the page, and complete the books, especially the translated western version. Then include the book genre, novel or biography or what book."
"Excuse me min, I haven't received a verification email from the ipusnas account, I want to borrow a book, thank you"
Very good
Increase the collection of the latest books
üëç
"The number of books is already a lot, but there are still many new books that have not been entered. The most worthy of improvement is the appearance of the pages of the book which in my opinion is still far from being ""comfortable"" to read. The writing is small, the pages are only white, some books can't be bookmarked. Maybe it can be improved so that readers are comfortable reading on iPusnas, they can imitate the Kindley. And, if you are comfortable reading, iPusnas can be a driving force to prevent book piracy."
Excellent
The number of books is still very small.. on a national scale.. more in the Gram***a bookstore. The process of borrowing books is also long and often fails.. Sad...
Excellent
good
Why now I can only borrow two books and it can't be returned before a day? I really hope that this apk can help and pay attention to students.

good
Extraordinary
You can add a table of contents to the details of the book to make it easier to find material
Nice app and very useful. Suggestion if it can be given a filter feature based on the book rating
"How do you verify your email, bro? I haven't tried checking the inbox but there is no incoming message. I've been waiting for hours and it doesn't come out. How are you?"
"Hello iPusnas! This application is very useful. Especially for people who want to read books, but are constrained by budget. However, can you also include Indonesian manuscripts that have been digitized? Thank you"
"You can borrow ebooks for free, unfortunately, the borrowing time is only three days, sometimes it's time to finish reading, and after updating the application, the bookmarks can't be used. Please fix again."
"26/08/2019 Thank you for continuing to develop this application. Very happy to be able to read various collections of books here. It's just that now I'm tired of going back and forth having to log in and often I can't even log in for some reason, even though the email and password are correct. Oh yeah .. and it seems to be slower loading. Update: 16/10/2019 It's good that this application has become better. Very smooth and always cool collection..thank you very much for all."
"Why can't I login with Facebook when I login, it says please wait for hours, it's taking too long."
Thank you very much. Very reliable!
Very helpful
"I'm not happy for the inconvenience, when I borrow a book, I'm told to choose an e-Pustaka, when I choose it can't be borrowed"
"Satisfied with using this application, the hobby of reading novels is channeled, I will give you a little input, because there are some novels that are not readable because the font selection is not suitable for all cellphones, please fix it. The title is a fairy tale about the time of Titi Sanaria's work."
"Thank God, hopefully the books can continue to be added"
gggg
iPunas is very helpful in writing thesis
"The apk is cool, it's just not complete, maybe the book collection. Please complete it again"
I like. An application that can help when you want to buy a book but there is no money üòÇ. Add more books hehe
good
Very helpful for me in getting the latest reference sources
"A good application, for the better do not limit to borrow the book."
"Good application, an alternative for those who are thirsty for books"
"Please extend the loan period. Often I haven't finished reading, but the borrowing time has run out"
"Reading can be done anywhere.. it would be better if the collections were presented from various libraries in Indonesia, both office libraries, regional libraries, university libraries, to school libraries.. and equipped with a collection of bookstores/other partners closest to the reader's position.. thank you"
Can help me in developing assignments
"It's good, but there are things that need to be developed. My advice, when reading mode it would be nice to have a page jump feature"
Look again for the desktop version... already logged in but it always says it requires client_id when I want to borrow a book
Perfect
Very good for education Especially those who like to read
"very helpful to me,"
ok
The book is very good...üëçüëçüëç
"It's nice to read a book, no need to bother anymore, just borrow it online and read it right away,,,"

Pleasant :)
"Thank you Ipusnas, because of you I can read legal books for free anywhere and anytime. Hopefully this application can increase the awareness of Indonesian people about the importance of reading culture. Greetings literacy :)"
The books are good but it's a shame you can't borrow more than 2 books/day..
"I can learn a lot, especially sewing, hopefully it will be more useful for reading lovers."
"Why is it now only possible to borrow 2 books per day, in the past you could 3. To read books to children, 2 books were not enough. A few minutes are also over"
great.....
It's great to be able to access so many books.
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN'T EMAIL VERIFICATION EVEN ALREADY ALREADY A DOG
"Very helpful for those who don't have money to buy original books. My suggestion is more detailed grouping of books. For example, there are translated novels, youth, religion, etc."
ok
Very helpful
Really good
"Ipusnas has changed a lot from its previous versions. Cool.. a good application provides many benefits for the community... hopefully in the future there will continue to be improvements both in terms of system speed, beauty of appearance, stable application and collection of more books.. Thank you..."
ok
It is very helpful to acquire knowledge in a lawful manner.
Good and quality
Literacy life
Very usefulüôÉ
Wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh When will you add more books? And why only 2 per day?üòì
Application of a million knowledge that can be enjoyed for free..thank you
Pleasant
Great time no cans
"Very helpful in finding sources for reading all genres, although not everything you are looking for is there. In the future, maybe the duration of the loan can be extended even more and the limit for borrowing in a day can be more than 3 books üôèüèª"
"Experience that is achieved by itself without the intervention of others, and in the future will be enjoyed for yourself and others"
Excellent

Very helpful!!!!!! Thank you‚ù§Ô∏è
"Great, please add the library collection."
Can read for free. Thank you
Don't know how to verify email
"Want to ask there it says .. You have not verified gmail. Check the inbox or spam box and please contact the admin.. But I'm confused where to contact the admin, okay?"
"I'm sorry I downgraded it, I used to be very happy with ipusnas. But why are the provisions now different? The limit for borrowing books is 2 days? The speed is min, it's better to go back to the old provisions of 3 days. I chose ipusnas because the loan period used to be quite long, if it was like this, it would be the same. Where do you often get errors?"
"If you want to read it, you can't, you just keep coming out... and if you come back, you have to wait 24 hours"
How come I can't verify my email? So I can't borrow it sis
Upgrade again.
"Many collections of educational books that educate the nation's buds, thank you Ipusnas"
I'm still waiting for registration
"Min, I want to login, why can't it? Playing continues even though the network is okay."
Very useful to help complete the task
"Every time I update the app gets worse and worse, the quality goes down... I uninstalled the app"
"Sir, why is Ipusnas on a maintenance laptop?"
"Please improve the system more, because it often exits the application suddenly and the book cannot be read even though it has been downloaded... thank you"
Until now still can't log in
"Very good application, good... But please increase the book borrowing limit.... Pliss"
"I want to borrow a book but it says I haven't verified my email, even though I checked my email, there hasn't been an incoming email."
"I can't read the book because it always says ""You haven't verified your email. Check your inbox or spam box if you haven't found it or please contact the Ipusnas admin"" so what should I do? Even though my account is already registered. Please help"
"How come I can't borrow the book, so I can't read it, I have to verify the email even though I've signed in with my email"
"For everyone who helps in facilitating the literature, the best support should be given... then the National Institute of Sciences will develop and if possible the book will be available in full"
Thank you ipusnas It really helped me in my research
"please add a bookmark button for a book you like or a bookmark for a book to read, thank you"
"Min, why when I want to borrow I ask for email verification, while I have registered my email in this iPusnas account"
Often read Ipusnas collections which make it easier to access reading sources
"Can't login using an account that has been registered on a computer/laptop, you have to register again, so you register twice, it's not flexible, just enter it"
"Hopefully Ipusnas has more collections, so it's better to be able to read"
Very helpful
I AM VERY HAPPY TO READ THE BOOKS IN THE IPUSNAS APPLICATION. I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THE IPUSNAS APPLICATION CAN BE INTELLIGENT. BUT PLEASE IMPROVE IT FOR IPUSNAS APPLICATION USERS TO READ IT.
Educate the nation's children
Why do you often go out alone when you want to read a book after borrowing it and have downloaded it... :'(
"this app is very good, but the old books are rarely available like publications from the library.. hopefully more old books will be reproduced.."
Good. With this app I can save money to buy monthly books.
"Sorry, I didn't get the Yalla confirmation code, then how did I read it??"
an application that i can learn history
Very helpful... Love it
Very helpful.
"Why can't my Ipusnas be opened? Even though yesterday was fine. Suddenly it went out on its own and when you wanted to enter it said ""unable to retrieve data from server and no DLS, close the application"" and so on :("
Please increase the borrowing time and borrowing limit. I think the current one is still unsatisfactory But overall it's good and the book is quite complete
"Thank you, hopefully Indonesian literacy will be more advanced"
email verification took so long :(
Cool
Why can't I enter??üò¢
Good app
find script references easier
"The application is good, I like it, the philosophy book is quite complete"
Why do you always force close when you want to start reading Position on Android 9 Hopefully it will be fixed quickly Still not fixed?
"How come the Ipusnas application can't log in, because I don't want to login via fb, I tried using email when I borrowed the book, I had to verify my email first, how come after verification it doesn't work?"
Ipusnas is very helpful
Why can't I borrow books from Ipusnas even though I've registered?
"Sorry, why, when I went to Ipusnas I wanted to borrow but was told to register but it took so long to fix it please"
"Assalamualaikum min, why is it that when I borrowed Apollo I couldn't open it, it kept coming out, even though I really wanted to read it, please fix it if there's an error, even though the other book can be opened, it's still not fixed"
"Ipusnas is better back to the old provisions.. the new provisions are detrimental, the period of returning books must wait 24 hours before they can be returned.. sometimes not all the books we borrow are good, we want to return them but have to wait 24 hours it's a waste time. Then the rule of 2 books per day??? It's better if the old rule can be borrowed 3 books per day.. this is not improving the quality but decreasing the quality, bookmarks often don't work, so I can't mark, it's getting messy Ipusnas has been updated"
Perfect
Very nice
üëç
This app is very useful
So excited
This application is very good for educating the children of the Indonesian nation. It's free and you can read books anywhere. Hopefully the collection will be more complete.
"I'm disappointed why the ipusnas application is no longer like it used to be, now borrow the verification book. My question is, what verification is it, please don't make an application like this"
Good even though the loading is a bit heavy
Complete book. Easy system. The best
"How come it's a bit strange, I borrowed Georgette Heyer's book on my Samsung cellphone when I wanted to read it (I finished downloading the loan) instead I went back to my own home, but when it was on my Oppo I could open it. But for the book into the water you can, why is that?"
Why can't I return the book? ._.

"Lately, the app often comes out on its own, even though before it was normal.. It's a shame it's a good app"

Very helpful
Thank you very much
"Lots of old Indonesian novels, please"
"The application is good, very helpful in the world of lectures that require a lot of references. The only minus is that the books are limited, especially regarding sharia books, which are still lacking. Please complete it again"
Nice experience
Why is it so difficult for my account to return books??
Gud
Very helpful
"Just about to open the application, it says not connected to DLS and others, it's a shame the application is outdated and cannot be used. I hope there is a fix soon. *Note: my cellphone is in Oreo position, maybe others have experienced the same thing."
"It's good enough because there are many books and there is a collection of character books. However, just before opening it for the first time, I had a hope that there would be books in the physics category and other science themes. I only found other categories of science and did not find physics categories. I really like physics though. I'm currently in college and hope to get additional books to study physics"
great
Try first
"With this application, it is so helpful, it's just that the list of books is not complete"
The book is complete
"It's good, there are many books that I can read. But I want to ask if I borrowed a book and the day after tomorrow, how come it disappeared right away? And I have to wait for the stock of the book, then I can read it again. Please enlighten bro/brother...."
I like it thank you ipusnas
"Really good. Unfortunately, the loan is limited to 2. Then it can only be returned after 1x24 hours. Hmmmm"
"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for making this application, it is very helpful for me personally who just wants to get to know books ^.^"
"Hello min I often read on Ipusnas and the books are complete, but there are some books when they are downloaded, when you want to open it and want to read the book, the application immediately exits and always says ""close the application"" or return to beginning."
"Today I borrowed a book which is quite large for a 300 sheet book, but when I opened it suddenly the application force closed. Hopefully this problem will not be found again in the next application update."
Why does reading a book have criteria? Have to complete the mission? Is this not meant to help people?
The ebook that has been borrowed cannot be opened
"Sis, how come I can't verify the email, I've tried many times even though"
Complete online book library
Very helpful
"Please help, I've logged in several times but I can't help but the books are all good"

"I like to read and have a hard time buying books, economic factors. Ipusnas is very helpful. I enjoy hobbies thanks to Ipusnas with love. However, why now can only borrow 2 books per day? Sometimes I find interesting books after borrowing other books. So, the opportunity to borrow will come tomorrow."
Are there any more disturbances? I tried to access the stock so all 0. Please follow up
"I like it, because it's easier to read, but how come the number of books that can be borrowed has decreased per day? Usually 3 books, how come this can only be 2? Thank you iPusnas"
"Great book, only a few books, please add more"
"I really like this iPusnas application, the books are complete and we can read them for free. In fact, the book is good and complete. It's enough that we have internet quota. Unfortunately, borrowing books is limited, you can only borrow 2 times a day. That's troublesome for a nerd. Try not to be limited in the future."
"Ipusnas is very useful for me, there are many choices of books that I like. Thank you ipusnas"

"Good application, I like it üòä"
nice very helpful lol
good good
"Ipusnas is very helpful, especially in areas where there are no libraries and bookstores. It's just that there is no option to view the contents of the book before borrowing. So if you haven't borrowed it, you can't see the contents of the book."
"Good app and complete book. If possible, the loan period can be extended again"
Very helpful in finding reading references
"Looks like the apps are good.. but every time I want to read, I'm always given a notification ""you haven't verified your email"" even though it's already... please fix it üôèüèª"

Very helpful for me personally as a student
"It's good, so that Indonesia doesn't have a reading crisis. please develop and socialize more, I'm sure many don't know Ipusnas"
Need to update very often
"I've read this e-book over and over again and it's hard to remember. It's different from a physical book, reading it is focused because it's really a book and doesn't make phubbing."
"Now if you want to borrow it, you have to return it in 1√ó24 hours. For example, if you borrow a book but the book is not good or you have finished reading it, you can't borrow it again."

One more thing, please add more digital books, okay, because some of the books I'm looking for aren't there yetüòÅ"
Ipusnas is very helpful in finding books to write my thesis

"I think this ipusnas application is a very good application to use. We can read books anytime and anywhere. However, there is one thing I don't like about this ipusnas application, which is the very short borrowing time of books, which is only 3 days. My advice is to increase the time for borrowing books to 1 week."
really ok
Good but mostly error sometimes
Continue to educate the nation's children..

Very helpful for me who is not strong enough to buy books
"Still too many bugs. Sometimes apps like to exit on their own. There has also been a borrowed book that is not saved, later after the application is restarted it will appear. But not bad for the size of a government application (free anyway). Please fix it"
"I really like it, I'm not lazy to go to the library, but this is Alhamdulillah, it's more than enough. Complete"
"It's quite good, only the display/writing is still too small so it needs to be slightly enlarged or maximized according to the general cellphone screen.. Please also add more new and updated books, especially about national figures.. Thank you IPusnas, opening a window to the world through books"
very useful app :)

Enough to help me to seek knowledge
It's good... I hope the book collection will be added again
Very nice. It's easier to read books wherever you are. There is also no need to enliven piracy.
The collection is still not much
"I kept on wondering, I just found out about Ipusnas, after watching TV there was a digital library program belonging to Boyolali Gunung Kidul, even though IPusnas was released in 2016, I think Ipusnas lacked socialization, maybe it needs a promo this time, I immediately downloaded Ipusnas, because I like reading when I want to sleep , Hopefully this application is good and great. FORWARD INDONESIA."
"The application is good, very helpful, but it needs some improvements and developments, especially: 1. regarding borrowing and returning, 2. If possible, next to the cover image of the book, the table of contents of the book should be affixed so as not to borrow wrongly, 3. Add a page search feature so as not to scroll manually, 4. Verification that sometimes doesn't come in, 5. collection of books, I hope this criticism and suggestion can help, thank you"
Very nice
Best

"Loading is very slow (even though the network is good), for some reason it often fails to borrow books, often logs out itself, and it is very difficult to log in again. Very disappointing. *Edit A few minutes after I wrote this review, the developer responded, apologizing because the app is currently under maintenance and suggesting that I clear the cache and then log back in. It turned out to be successful, the application loading went quickly and book borrowing could be done. Thank's a lot"

Not a day without reading üòç
What is the password file?
The app is good. It's just that I beg for ipusnas to further improve the quality of the application. Very often the app crashes and suddenly logs out by itself. Apart from that it's good.

Can't open
Thank God I can login :)
"I haven't been able to borrow books because I can't login to my FB or Email account, but the problem with logging in to the app has been fixed"
"Since last year it's always the same problem, it's hard to log in. The application always crashes. I'm so annoyed even though I really need to look for book references at this Ipusnas :("
Why now the error continues even though the internet connection is good Very disappointing
"At first it was very helpful, but when I came here Ipusnas often messed up, even though the signal was good, but why is it so hard to borrow books, sometimes I like to leave my account on my own. I'm loading, I'm going to read the book."
"The app is good, but how come you keep logging in often, please fix the serverüôè"
It keeps crashing and can't be assessed
Still like logging out alone :(
"The connection for playing games is smooth but when I open Ipusnas there is a connection problem, I can't read and see the history of books that have been borrowed"
"Lately, the application often exits and logs out by itself, even though there is no problem with the data network. The application is good, there are a lot of books. Please improve the performance of the application, yes."
"I really like the application, I'm downloading it again, I like the error to log in"
Too many errors. And a few books on display. Very disappointed...üò¨
"Why do I often get errors, even though the book is very complete but I can't read it because I can't open it"
Errors keep on
Why do I have to log in every time I open Ipusnas? Where is the error now written? Tired of life

"They say maintenance is until noon, why is it still possible until night hhhh"
"This feature is great.. It's really, really.. Can you please fix it, why is it that when I look for a book, it's really loading.. Then if you want to return the book, you can't even return it.. Even though the network is good.."
"I really like the ipusnas application. Makes my reading mood always increase. Ipusnas is currently under maintenance, when will the maintenance finish? And what causes maintenance? It's actually quite annoying. But hopefully maintenance is done to add to the convenience of readers and is not experiencing serious trouble."
more and more useless
"Frequent errors when logging in or want to borrow. Network time out continues, even though the connection is fine"
"Why suddenly an error when logging in?, even though before it was possible, it ran smoothly without any problems"

"Min, Ipusnas can fix the network. It's been really bad lately. Every time I open the app, it keeps getting errors. Can't do anything. It keeps asking for re-login but it keeps getting errors. As a daily Ipusnas user, I feel very uncomfortable with this. Thank you"
I used to often go out alone and now I can't even log in to Ipusnas
"First of all, because I can't log in either with Facebook or gmail"
Not enough
"Why is there an error when I try to log in on another cellphone, I can't do it.. It's difficult to do college assignments"
"The application is good, but it is very difficult to log in, it can take all day trying to log in. That's right again -_______-"
"Incomplete, frequent errors."
I like to log out myself and it's hard to log in :( this app should be very helpful but it doesn't improve a little more :)
"The application is useful but it often crashes and it's hard to borrow the book, so I'll just give it 1 star!"
"really good in terms of content, but from the application it often logs out, takes a long time to load on the first page, there are also books that can't be viewed... thanks"
"Suggestion, why not notify via email if maintenance will be carried out? So that loyal users can prepare themselves."
Is ipusnas having an error again?
"Add another collection of best-selling fantasy genre novels, dong mi min"
"Search... Applications that can't be used. Super slow loading. It's said that I borrowed again, can't you just look at the list of books?"
"I like and appreciate the government for making this application. However, there are still many shortcomings. Logging out yourself and finding it difficult to log back in is the most troublesome obstacle for users. Hopefully Ipusnas will be better in the future"
Disappointing
"It's good but there are frequent connection time outs and long load screens, please fix it"
Expand the book
"Good application, very useful for myself personally. I like reading to broaden my horizons, it's just that when I'm cool to read I like to log out myselfüòÅ, hopefully it can be fixed."
"Before buying a book, I saw the book on this app. Leaks for example. However, it is not convenient to re-register frequently and one day is full of errors. It's just the climax, the error is long. Hasten to be repaired."
"4 first, sis. Sorry in advance, but why is it getting an error now? I've been trying but it's still the same. Or am I wrong?"
"I was greatly helped by this application, indeed there are still shortcomings, but still, thank you. Hopefully in the future it will be even better."
"This app was good before. However, after updating, the loading is often problematic, whether using quota or wifi. Login and the process of borrowing the book is getting more and more difficult. Please fix it soon because I like this app"
I have registered via email but why can't I login? Please help
"How come the application often has errors, especially if you want to borrow a book, it takes a long time to load, then when you log out, you want to enter your email pass, you can't press the next button"
"I still like to log out myself and it's very difficult to enter, the borrowing bookshelf also likes to disappear by itself and being asked to borrow it again, even though the application is very helpful, please fix it..."
It takes a long time to load and likes to log out on its own. I really like this book app. Lots of reading for both lessons and entertainment. Very helpful. Please fix the Ipusnas kk2 in terms of application performance. Thanks
"Please please!!. Don't like to lag, you know, books that are being borrowed are redownloaded and then you always have to install the app again to fix this app again. If you use the error gtu (aka not responding) . If you already know that this app is vital for its existence because it is very helpful, especially for students, please don't even make fun of us as users!!"
"the application is good, but it's hard to log in again!!!!!!!!!!! please fix it, it's not slow and it's easy to log in...!!!! why is the error so bad, please fix it"
error mulu gemes :((((
bad. It's really hard to log in. Please fix!!!!!
How long is this error? Please hurry
"How come it's hard to log in now, please fix it. Thank you"
"Can't log in continuously, long loading. Even though using a WiFi connection"
"It's good.... But please add more book collections.... Also, please fix the application, sometimes I like to log out myself..."
National class application. Often opens and closes itself.
Can not login
"The application error often increases, how about this, they say, they want to educate the nation's children, but the application error"
Often lags even though I like this apk. Hopefully it will be better in the future.
THE ORIGINAL IS SEVERE SLOWLY OUTSTANDING IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO LOG IN TO MAKE AN EMOTION!!! ONCE YOU CAN LOG IN SUDDENLY TO THE OWN LOG OUT ORIGINALLY IS EASY BUT THIS IS A GOOD APPLICATION BUT HARD TO USE!!
Lots of references. Very helpful
"Since the last trouble, it was quickly responded to and returned to its original application. But somehow after 2 months the error came back again and could not log in and view the book catalog. Please help again."
Want to ask if this apk is paid?
"Why is this, please, why can't I enter?"
Very helpful..thanks y
"Often timeouts are unclear, accounts often log out by themselves. If you enter an old apk, it's a waste of time. Lots of bugs too. It's a shame that the government's apk only works like this"
Unable to open after a while.
"Very helpful.. But please improve the application even more, because the account still often logs out and sometimes has to be re-downloaded.."
Best
Why can't it be used at all?
please fix the application. the account suddenly logout and I try to make a relogin always fails. Ô∏è
"Log out yourself, and entry is difficult, please don't fix that part"
How come the application keeps logging out?
Can't login
"The feature is fixed, please, when the reading display mode is set to dark mode, it's still bright... Please fix it, thx."
"I like this apk, there are lots of novels and even references for my college assignments. But, why do you like to log out yourself? Not even once or twice, in fact often log out alone. My friend also wants to log in but can't. Please fix it, the apk is good, it's a shame if the apk error."
"Applications that really help me to read more often, thank you. Please fix it again, because there are often errors."
"the application often has unclear errors, and it's also difficult to log in, how can you increase people's interest in reading +62 like this"
"It was smooth at first, but now it's starting to crash. Keeps reloading :( even though I need it."
"At the beginning of the installation, you can login but when you exit the application, you can logout yourself.. when you re-login, you can't enter.. hadehh.."
"This application is really cool, really helps improve reading. So the book money can be used to buy other necessities. My suggestion is to provide a feature to search for book pages that we have borrowed so that you don't get tired of sliding around. The problem is that if you are 200 pages and above, you are very tired of sliding. Hope the advice is heeded."
"What are the implications in the development stage, how come the connection is not stable, Samsung often gets this error, huh?"
"It's good, you can read books for free. There are many choices of books. But the application often crashes, and logs out on its own. So you have to keep logging in"
"The apk is really good, but it often comes out on its own. I'm so lazy that I have reinstalled several times, but after a long time I get annoyed"
"From a good appearance, please increase the collection of books, such as literature, philosophy, etc., also please correct any errors that still exist, such as force stop tbtb, log out yourself and when you want to log in again sometimes you have to force stop first this application so DIFFICULT me and maybe other users. Thank you"
"The application is very useful, by providing E-books according to the category we want to read, but the application system needs to be improved, my user account often logs out after that if I log in using a password, registered email, or Facebook I can't login."
Really like this application. The collection of books is large and can be read everywhere. But unfortunately lately it's often logout and unknown errors. Hopefully Ipusnas can do better. It's so cool :)
Very helpful for reference assignments
"The first time the download was mediocre, but over time there were often errors, especially when the error failed to connect. Please fix it soon!!!"
"The rate is for now, yes. The problem is that there are still many shortcomings, including: 1. Often logs out by yourself and is still difficult to enter again 2. Sometimes books like to disappear from the shelves. And it took us a long time to find books again. 3. The appearance is still fairly boring. If you want to make it elegant, maybe you can reference a google book or something. But thank God, I am still loyal to Ipusnas, because that way I hope that Ipusnas can develop more. cheers"
"Mashallah, sometimes there are errors, sometimes not, logging in is difficult, is the factor wanting to move to Kalimantan too?"
Very helpful in daily life
"Thanks to this application, it can add insight to develop knowledge in the world of education."
"Frequent network errors, even though the network is stable"
"The application is very helpful, but there are some books that do not have a copy even though there are no borrowed ones."
Ok.. Try me first
"I feel helped by this application. But in terms of graphics and ease of use need a lot of improvement. I also haven't found a manual for lay users. If the display and graphics can be improved, I think this app will really support the advancement of Indonesian literacy. Greetings Literacy"
Recently can't log in. Often logs out alone
I really support this application. Hopefully it can increase the reading interest of young people who usually prefer to hold gadgets than holding books.
There's an error now... overall it's good. It's just a matter of extending the loan period. Don't be like that for 3 days
"How do you want to download, the server connection is disconnected, my connection is stable. This is what makes the app the intention or not"
"We installed this on the xiaomi note7, an unknown error appeared and the application couldn't, admin, please fix it."
"Good, the books are free and quite a lot. But unfortunately the application often crashes, sometimes every time you want to open the app you have to log in and sometimes it's difficult to login. Then, if you want to borrow a book, there is an error too. Pls fix in. thanks"
Like errors and books that have been borrowed suddenly disappear. Account likes to go out on its own.
"What the hell... How come this National Application... Not good quality... Errors... Just fix it, wow."
Please improve the server
The license agreement is not solid and not neat. Try to consider the user's personal identity.
"why can't it be opened, why is Ipusnas?"
"The app is good. Really helpful. Unfortunately there is no feature to add books to read later. So if we find a good book, but we can't read it at that time, then we have to look for that book again"
ipusnas often has errors like that. Then I can't open the book I've borrowed. I'm a bit disappointed with the application.
"I feel, there are still many books that are not yet in this National Library of Indonesia, so I hope for the developers of this application to add to their catalogs of books so that everyone can read easily in this application."
"Oops, why does the application often error and logout automatically, and the book that has been borrowed is not there, please follow up, is there no enlightenment, this is how the application keeps getting errors :("
often suddenly can not borrow books. I have to log in again but I can't even log in
"Frequent errors, suddenly logs out by yourself,, Hopefully it can be improved!!"
Thank you very useful üëç
"I am happy with the iPusnas app, I can finally read the books on my reading list. A few months ago I downloaded this application, but because it often lags I finally uninstalled it, thank God now it rarely lags. Besides that, I hope that in the next update maybe a feature can be added to archive books that I want to read, because sometimes I want to save the book first and then borrow it later. Thank you"
Less complete
"Log out too often, when I want to log in again I can't"
Ipusnas why huh??? Why can't I borrow a book?
It's fun and important so I recommend you to download this app
"The application can't be used, if you want to read it, you have to log in first. When I login, I have entered the user and the pass, even when I press the next button, it doesn't process at all. Once it's mrose, it's even an error..."
easier to read books with ipusnas..
Can one account not log in in two places? (PC and HP) sometimes like to log out by themselves. Hopefully it will be fixed soon.
"Ipusnas please fix this app again. In that week there must be a problem loading the page. Ask to log in first. Already logged in, eh, I don't go to the main page. Don't just add a collection of books"
"Error, I can't login, I'm surprised that I still need the book"
"Please add more books, and I also found a lot of books that can't even be borrowed, the number of copies is also 0, what's the format of this, if it can't be borrowed, it's better to just delete it from the list, it's a pity for people who need the book, it turns out I can't even borrow the feeling of being hit by PHP. Thank you"
"Applications often crash, borrowed books often disappear suddenly. Sometimes it's hard to log in"
First error and re-login but still RTO
Need to add more to his collection of new books.
Server maintenance? Since yesterday I wanted to borrow a book but how come the mt server?
Yuhuu
"I haven't been able to borrow books for a long time. The server is under maintenance, isn't it, min?"
"Actually I like ipusnas, but ipusnas often logs out by itself and sometimes it's hard to log in. Please fix it again. Cheers bro :)"
"Errors often make it uncomfortable to use, please admin, fix it"
"it's really good, it's just frequent disturbances, please fix it, min, so that it fits the slogan of educating the nation"
"new book borrowed/downloaded in the morning, lost in the afternoon...so you have to download it again...please fix the application.."
"Why did you just open the app and then immediately log out yourself suddenly. So confused. When I want to read the book I borrowed yesterday. Please fix it, thank you."
"Thank God I found this app, I just found out what it is because I saw Najwa Shihab's talk show recommending reading with a cellphone in an online library, so it's really lucky for me who is far from the library"
very helpful
"Come on, server maintenance suddenly without a schedule, borrowed books even crashed. This app needs improvement."
"hello ipusnas, why can't i borrow books? maintenance continues... already logged in, stock is also available.."
"I like it, finally there is an application like this, you can read it when you have free time, but there are still books that you can't read"
Very good
"a very useful application for those who like to read/find books/references. please add Pram's books, Earth of Mankind, Hunting, Reverse Flow, etc. thanks"
"good. but I like to log out myself when I'm reading. please fix it, so that it will be easier for Indonesian people and happy to read literacy."

"why can't I log out myself, and it's hard to log in,"
"I often log out myself, and when I want to log in it's very difficult. Hopefully it can be corrected."
"Nice app. Support everyone to love reading. In a practical way we can read anywhere, anytime"
"It's good, it's complemented by the books, especially the translated novels!üòòüòç"
error frequency
"I want to give advice. For the next update, please provide a fast scrolling feature (like in iJak and other ebook readers). Because when the loan period runs out, and I try to borrow and download again, I have to scroll one by one until the last page I read. Imagine I scroll through 600 pages one by one which takes up to 2 minutes. Please consider. Thanks :)"
very good
OK
very helpful
"every time you open the application you have to login first. and it's difficult to log in, whether it's using data or wifi, it still takes a long time to load, and if you log in with an email account, the password keeps getting wrong even though it's true, please update this application again because this application is useful, many books that we sometimes look for in stores or libraries don't exist"
"please fix it min, like to log out yourself"
"It's really difficult to log in, please follow up on the review, don't let it just be a display, greetings literacy"

"I think it's good because there are quite a lot of books. However, it would be nice if the famous books or books that are most interested in are reproduced so that they don't have to wait in long queues for book borrowers."
steady
"how do you want a mental revolution if the application is more stupid, login is difficult, when a network class WiFi connection is said to be a lag error. please fix this, this is very helpful, but if it's an error, it's hard"

"Ipusnas is really annoying, often logs out by myself, can't open books that have been borrowed. every time you click on a book that has been borrowed, you will immediately log out. please fix it...."
"why lately the application has been wrong, so I can't read books anymore on ipusnas, please fix it"
"Well, I don't know if I'm the only one who has experienced this or others also have this problem, iPusnas tbtblog out itself, not just once. It's really hard to log in again, I haven't read the book, but it stops by itself. It's a bit annoying, but I hope that in the future Ipusnas will be even better, so that those who use it will enjoy it too. Good luck for Ipusnas in the future"
grandiose error
"The application is good, but there are a few problems. It's like it's hard to bookmark a book, so if you want to continue reading, you have to go back to the beginning. then the function of the three-dot button in the right corner can't be used, then the panel when you're reading is annoying. suddenly appeared, suddenly disappeared. so hard to focus. please fix"
"When will the application be repaired and upgraded, min??"
"disappointed that there has never been an improvement, just yes, yes, please update it, it's hard to even read a book"
Really good

"after logging in, then change to open another application. I want to read the book I borrowed, why do I have to log in again, it's too bad"
"It's good I really like it. but often bugged, out of network and logged out by myself. sometimes it's hard to log in. It's a bit of a pity, even though if it goes smoothly, there will be a lot of fans"
Many bugs such as different book covers when scrolling and often logging out on their own
"how come I can't download the book?, every download it says you don't have a hold item"

"It was good at first. then suddenly when I open the server it time out and it fails to refresh. then I uninstalled and installed again. after that every time I want to read a book suddenly ""the application has stopped"". how is this please fix. I am really disappointed because through this ipusnas my work has become smoother but now it is delayed. developers please :("
"Edit the review a bit. In the past few days, Ipusnas has no more errors. So, I'm happy. Hopefully the application will continue to grow and progress. Oh yeah, maybe there needs to be socialization so that many people know about this application. Especially those whose doms are in remote areas like me, where it is difficult to get a supply of books because they are quite expensivev: so that many people use them and the culture of literacy is embedded from an early age. Also to minimize the prevalence of pirated books and ebooks. Bravo for IpusnasTeam<3"
"sometimes have to download again, but it really helps so 4 stars first."
greetings literacy
"A good application to increase people's interest in reading, but there are several things that become obstacles, namely the application often logs out by itself and in my opinion it looks less attractive so that readers feel monotonous with the appearance of the application"

"How come my Ipusnas logouts itself, then I can't log in again huft"
"good, but often logs out alone huh"
"the collection is pretty complete, it's cool, but there are some problems using this application such as problems logging in, having to re-login when exiting the app, the downloaded book suddenly disappeared from the reading list at this time, but it's still on loan, so you have to queue again, and please if you can menu When the reading mode is set to long-press, it just appears because it's very annoying when the popup menu is reading, when you swipe the menu appears again, moreover, the menu color is blue which is quite a contrast to the background reading mode :(((("

"Sorry, only 3 stars, honestly the application is very helpful for those of us who have minimal costs to buy books, it's just that the application is still quite bad, for example the book we read we have downloaded, we just have to stay for a while, we have to download it again, sometimes we also like to go out itself, dark mode also doesn't exist, sometimes you have to log in again and again, and there's no Favorite feature or feature to mark books that we'll read while waiting for the book we're reading to finish reading."

"I'm confused, I often log out myself, then it becomes difficult to log in again. I've been patient once or twice, but this happens too often. even though this is a really good apk for those who like to read. please help to find a solution as soon as possible.

"Just a suggestion, we can modify the password ourselves according to what we want, so we don't have to check it from the email, because the password is complicated and often forgets and the apk often logs out by itself even though we don't log out"
upgrade again
üëç
"I'm glad I got this, so I don't have to go far to the library which is a kilometer away. thank you sis. maybe the book can be added again the duration of the loan maybe 5 days"
Please add more to the collection to make it more complete
Cool application Hopefully it can continue to be maintained and can be more developed
"-_- It's very difficult to log in, how do you want to read it? Even though the online book collection is quite complete. please help me! every time I log in there is always an unknown error. hesh."
Book borrowing time is too short
logout often... hard to log in... hopefully all those who use it can be patient
"This is a really good application, read the book as much as you want. But there is no borrowing history. Sometimes, if you haven't finished reading the book, you've lost the book, and you forget the title. Thanks.."
RICH DAD POOR DAD BOOK IS NOT AVAILABLE ??? please add more to make it more complete
"very helpful, you don't have to go far to find a library to read books, wherever you can read books, add more book collections, bro, knowledge books especially hehe"
"actually this iPusnas application is very helpful, but recently my iPusnas account logged out itself and when I wanted to log in again it took a long time to load. please fix the system again so it doesn't interfere."
"sorry 2 stars. Initially I knew this apk was from one of the authors and continued to download. First, enjoy this apk because almost everything is there. but getting here, it's getting a little weird. I've logged in, but suddenly I logged out by myself. then I just want to log in, it's impossible. My friend also wants to log in but it's too long, it can't. how is this please continue with the handling of this apk. it's good but still like this. I'm disappointed for book lovers"
"An amazing app, an app that will keep you wanting to read the books in it. Hopefully this application will continue to exist in the future and the Indonesian people have a better interest in reading. Thank you min, this application allows me to read various books that are not even in bookstores now. I hope you stay healthy, and always be able to provide good literacy material for the community"
"they say the national library, but how come the books are not complete,"
I like books at the National Library. Interesting book. Now I just found out that there is an application to read books online from the National Library. Reading becomes easier and you don't have to go far to the National Library anymore. Congratulations on developing this useful application
i like this app üòäüòÑ
"develop again admin, spread active reading"
give 5 stars if you are satisfied
"actually I have not used this application, but here I just want to ask, is the application charged? I'm afraid that I'll be charged later"
try first
sometimes it disappears and you have to re-login
"A cool application, making it easier for us to borrow books without having to go to the library. It's great, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, install it :)"
"Why can users logout themselves? Admin, please fix it again so that you don't ask for login frequently, it's often wrong passwords even though the passwords are correct."
"Good, for developing literacy"
Often logs out alone
it's a good application. the collection is large. only the data must be smooth. keep getting errors and having to log back and forth. also there needs to be a night mode too. so that it's good to read at night
"Often I suddenly log out myself, and when I want to log back in, I can't. please sir how is this?"
iPusnas is fun....I like itüòòüòò
"I can't login, so it's hard to access"
"Very nice. can increase public interest in reading. hopefully in the future, ipusnas will have more and more features."
"I like this national facility, it's just that if it looks smoother it might be more interesting, thank you..."
"Thank you dear admin because of this application, I who can't always buy books can still read the books I want for free. Continued success, greetings literacy ^_^"
the list is a bit complicated
good and increase knowledge
Enrich the life of a nation
juoosss but rung iso doesn't download
why are there no ads sir why i just found out now haha
meee
"a good application for the literacy of the Indonesian nation, but please the days for borrowing books can be extended and of course the books for college students have more references, okay?"
"this application is very good but can damage the eyes quickly,, please improve the appearance, the size of the text / font is very small .. this is very troublesome."
"very good, very helpful..."
"Overall this application is good and helpful, but it would be better if the collection of books was more complete and thankfully there are new books"
very helpful
okay
"Thank you Ipusnas, the book can be said to be complete. Especially for books published in 2018 and below. Thank you very much anyway, so I can save on buying books (even though I still buy other books that are not yet available at Ipusnas. My advice is to get more comics, Min hehehe"
"The 3 day loan period seems too short, if possible, please increase it to 7 days so it's delicious. Read it more relaxed too"
"What's the difference between ecatalog and popular? I want to borrow the catalog, how come it always runs out. what's the difference between being popular?"
"I logged in using an email account, because I can't use fb,"
good
"The book is complete, but you have to read it if you have a package, if you don't have an internet package you can't read it. Even then, if you want to read what has been downloaded, ask to borrow it again. it's called throw away the package."
"It's really hard to just log in, I can't use fb, I can't even use email, please enlighten Ipusnas, thanks."
can read a book unfortunately can borrow only two days
Great apps. It's just that please give a mode with a dark background so it doesn't hurt your eyes too much when reading at night.
good
"So far, there are still some things that are still buggy, but I appreciate the creation of the iPusnas application, it is very useful. The collection has been added, yes, the books in foreign languages, good job!! keep up the good worküëç"
"Why is it that when I open a file that has been downloaded, the application suddenly exits by itself. Please prioritize more because this digital application is very helpful."
Can not login
"When I want to log in via fb, how come I can't and when I try via email, I can't, bro, please explain"
good
this application is very helpful enough for someone to read but in my opinion this application is not mobile friendly please improve it again to make it easier for the reader :) #salamliterasi
"why are there so many books with 0 copies, while no one has read it yet and the queue has been so long. I feel like I'm in php because the book is in the catalog but there's no copy to read even though I've been waiting a long time. For example, the Gena Showalter novel, Cara Lockwood and many others."
"Previously I was greatly helped by this Ipusnas, but suddenly there was an error and my account was logged out, when I wanted to log in, it was very difficult, even though it was graduation season and college assignments"
"I give 4 stars because the book is complete, but I haven't read it yet. How come it's hard to register via fb, please wait. please fix. If I can enter and I enjoy this application, I will give 5 stars."
why can't my ipusnas be opened?
nice
I can't login via fb or email
"Thanks to this, you don't have to buy books at Garamed"
why can't i login?
good not good i still give 5 stars
why can't you login with facebook?
"Very helpful if you need to do assignments or research. But unfortunately, to protect copyright I suggest the application is developed so that it cannot take screenshots when opening the application. (Similar to some other reading applications where you can't do screen shoots) However, back to the policy of the National Library of Indonesia itself. Thank you for bringing libraries anywhere and everywhere^^"
"I like the books in this application, but please in the future if you can borrow more than 3 books and if you can, please eliminate queuing when you want to borrow books"
"Actually, the book collection is quite complete, but now there are more errors in loading the data. If you want to log in using your e-mail, you don't even respond at all. Borrowing books always fails, even though the stock is still very much. Downloaded but can't read. :("
why can't this be opened?
this is what i'm looking for. read practical books. I don't have to go to the library. Please add the collection. I'm looking for a book. good title2. There aren't any. the best seller.
"I'm sorry, this is an error, what's the way? my account logout many times** eh.hmm"
"dear admin, why when I want to borrow I can't. there is a warning ""you are not a member"" after it was asked to enter a password. even though I have registered .. and when I enter the password is wrong. even though the password is the same as when I registered."
"this is the best online library, the book is quite complete, it's good, keep improving it minüôèüôèüôèüôè"
Best !!
"good application, can read favorite books, but what really regrets why do you have to log in all the time, because of this problem I had to delete and download it again then when logging back in it took too long but it didn't work even though the network was good, please fix it ASAP"
it's good but sometimes it stops.
"sometimes after logging in for a few hours and then logging back in, even when logging in via FB and email sometimes it often fails oh yes please extend the loan term thank you"
"please optimize the application again, every time you download a book you have to log in again"
"Not bad.. I want to give advice, special story books for children.. the category of children's story books should be added.. so I don't get confused looking for storytelling for children.. thank you. btw, how do I donate a pdf of my collection of books to iPusnas?"
"the initial application is good, you can borrow books by logging in via email, but it's been 1 month I can't access using email, I don't know what the problem is with this application, even though this application really helped me in compiling my thesis. please help to login again so I can use it again"
"Very helpful for those who want to read books but are limited by funds, time and busyness. as a suggestion in the future so that bugs can be fixed on the iPusnas front page"
"The app is good and interesting. However, there are some bugs in the app. Please fix it for the next update. And also please increase the book borrowing period to 5 days."
"Sis, why can't I enter?"
"top markotop, recommended"
"The application is really good. I like it. I've read a lot of books here. But, I have a notification. Whether this is a typo from the author or from the editor or from where, there is an error in : Novel Tere Liye, Title Ceros & Batozar, page 345, in the words ""Gloves of the Earth and Gloves of the Sun"". Which should have written ""Moon Gloves and Sun Gloves"". Actually there are many other writing errors, but these are the most fatal. Please fix it..."
The book I'm looking for doesn't exist
Less complete
"Min, please fix the search feature, the rest is ok"
"the application is very good, very helpful, and all the books are complete. but when I want to look for another book, no search results come out even though it was there before. please fix something like that #salamliterasi"
I want to read a book.. I want to borrow a book.. but I can't enter the search..
error huh? why can't I find books to borrow through keywords?
Why do you often get errors now... it's just hard to log in
"why can't the application be registered, right?"
I've downloaded but I can't read the book. please fix the system
"very not good, every time you want to read it must be downloaded first even though we downloaded it the day before"
Very helpful but bad app or server. when suddenly the account logs out itself and has to log in again at a certain time
BGT USEFUL oath
"Thank God it's better now and the errors aren't too frequent, sometimes I still get errors but not as often as 3 weeks ago. thank you"
"My account suddenly disappeared, I can't log in again. please enlighten"
I like this application. to add insight into many books. oh yes my name is Shofia i like to read wherever i definitely bring a book. now that there is a library this is so much easier. I'm often called a god-level nerd. until now I still continue my habit.
"The duration of the loan should be more than 2 days, because readers are not only students who have free time to explore books to the fullest in their time but there are many background activities of someone who wants to also read books. This application is very helpful and useful as a science reference. thank you"
"bro, how come it doesn't work :("
"I actually like Ipusnas because it has a lot of book choices. it used to be smooth, but why now do you like to suddenly logout yourself? then if you want to find a book it takes too long to load, even though my network is good, other applications are also smooth. please improve again for Ipusnas, thank you."
"can't open the book, even the application exits by itself."
"Very nice! Thank you for making this app, very easy to use. I can read whenever I want. Anyway very good. Thank you( ` )Ôæâ"
"The application is good, but unfortunately there are still errors when logging in or even suddenly logging out and when logging in it always has an error. Please fix"

"Thank God there are rarely errors, thank you.. More and more ebooks are added, especially novels hehe.."
Disappointed
Very helpful
love it. Thank you for making this app. Very helpful for me who likes to read books‚ù§
"why do book loans often disappear even though it's only been 1 day, plus I often log out myself, I uninstalled the application first, I still appreciate the completeness of this app, greetings literacy"
the book is quite complete but errors often occur in the ipusnas application. please fix again.
"how come it's hard to log in,,,, even though previously I was able to log in üôè"
"it's good again, hopefully there won't be any more errors"
okay
why can't you log in? even though I can't wait to read it
"please fix it again, everything goes smoothly except when you want to read a book that takes too long to load, the book has not been read, the loan period has expired"
"why can't it be opened? always appears ""network timeout"""
good varied books. but unfortunately every month it automatically logs out
Please improve the searching system because it is very difficult to find the book we are looking for.....
I often log out myself and after that I can't even log in
"ok, no need to bother looking for books if you already have iPusnas"
"Very useful application for me. The drawback is that it takes a long time to login and has to be repeated because of frequent errors, even though the signal quality is not problematic. Hopefully it can be fixed."
"keep improving the system, min and keep updating the book, make Indonesia smarter. continued success"
I can't log in the app doesn't help many times I try to log in but it can't even make the app worse it doesn't help at all
"This application is quite good for contributing to the nation's literacy, but unfortunately this application still has many shortcomings, one of which is difficult when logging in using a Facebook account, please develop this application again, when the minister class application has many shortcomings, it's ridiculous"
free but like error
awesome
"it's good and very helpful, but why has this application on my cellphone crashed for 2 days and can't find the book I want to borrow. please fix it asap because i want to read more books"
"I like this Ipusnas application. But when I wanted to submit a book review, it failed again. Even though the internet connection is good. Confused where the problem is. If the problem comes directly from the app, please fix it considering I love to review books, I want to also review this Ipusnas"
very useful
why the app can't be opened?
"Thank you for holding this application. I hope that the increase in reading interest in Indonesia can increase rapidly. Honestly, when I opened this application for the first time, I was really surprised because the novels/books presented looked classy, ‚Äã‚Äãpopular, and matched what I wanted to find. Greetings Literature."
how come you can't enter?
good but often error
why can't enter the application
very helpful application. Please fix login and network timeout issues.
"I really like the presence of this application. I can read books anywhere and anytime, even able to finish one book at a time. But maybe gradually the collection can be added, especially old books. Then one more thing that is urgent, LATLY THIS APK CANNOT BE USED :( LOADING SERVER BOOK CAN'T. I'M SO HAPPY... HOPE IT CAN BE FIXED IMMEDIATELY... THIS APPLICATION IS VERY COOL, LIVE ON THE SYSTEM AND THE LOOK IS MORE LOOKING. THIS IS MAH"

"actually useful, but feels really heavy, especially when I open the book.."
sucks! the app keeps crashing!!

I can't log in now huh?
top

"many references that can be obtained but often experience many problems such as having to, it's difficult again, logging in continuously, buffering, difficult to borrow books and many other obstacles to access it"
keep error
please fix the server soon
"Lots of bugs. For example, when logging in network timeout. The data is not permanently saved, so when you want to borrow you have to log in again"
"why do you often log off yourself these days...? and to log back in is very difficult. Please fix it, Ipusnas. Thank you Ipusnas is very useful for me."
can't open at all.
a lot of lag
"actually I'm interested in using it, but after it was installed and opened it took a very long time to load and after several tries I finally managed to enter but failed to register, and tried again and failed again, finally uninstalled and waited for the development of this application."
the app can't be opened
always fails to enter and is stuck at the initial loading
problem
"The creators are very amateur, it seems I didn't anticipate that there would be a lot of downloads of the app, and now the app can't be accessed, I want to register/log in, I can't do anything, that's disappointing"
"this should be a good apk for adding references, it's just that the error is often unclear, the book has been borrowed, it can't be opened, it's hard to enter anyway, please fix it immediately because this application is very helpful but annoying"
very hard to open? it often doesn't connect to the internet network even though it's fine to open other apps. always log in every time you open it. please fix it soon
"Haven't entered yet, there's already a bug, how about the developer, even though this is an application on behalf of the government"
"thank you min for this ipusnas facility.. previously wanted to go to the library but time always didn't support it.. finally i can feel relieved with the presence of this app, i can read anywhere anytime, as well as college assignments so easy to do.. hopefully bug bugs error in this app can be fixed soon"
"sir, how much is the budget? little error. if not, let me ask Pak Jokowi."
very nice and very helpful
"sometimes when I open it, I like to error. sllu says file is missing. every time I open it asks to enter / re-login then it doesn't open. why so complicated. I'm sorry if this is the case, the best seller series is also reproduced"
there are still some bugs that need to be fixed
"thank you to the government for making this apk, it helps country children who have a high interest in reading but it is too expensive to buy books. so it helps with the iPusnas apk"
really good
"broken, just want to open it gbsa2, it's ridiculous"
"it's too lag even though the connection is smooth, please fix this problem and please multiply the stock for borrowing"
"I haven't opened Ipusnas for a month, I miss opening it, it turns out that now the reading feature can directly click on the destination, but how come the reading mode can't be changed other than scrolling down, but yesterday it could be side or page mode, why can't it be marked? Thank you"
How come I can't register? Ô∏è
"it's good, but the UI is a bit stiff"
"duh, boro¬≤ want to read a book, just can't log in"
can not be opened
"This application is very useful, but sometimes I can't log in"
"how do you log in, how come it can't work"
"Ipusnas is good, but I often log out myself, especially when I log in, it can take hours, even though the signal is good, and if you want to find a book or download it, it's difficult to open it because you often can't open it, even though there are lots of good novels, because because of frequent errors, it's hard to borrow it, please fix it again, thank you"

Min kq can't log in huh? Even though I want to read a book.. I want to find a reference for my assignment
this application is really very helpful .. but why do I always have trouble logging in if I haven't opened it for a few days
the server sometimes has trouble.
"why is it so hard to log in even though the signal is full. it's a good application, it really helps for final assignments as well as free time looking for books to read. I hope that in the future Ipusnas can be even better, so Ipusnas fans will not decrease."
"I really like and are helped by this reading application, because my house doesn't feel like enough to hold books while there are so many books that I want to read, only one thing that is very unfortunate. wifi that has a good network and sometimes the error lasts for days, it's not enough just a day ... even though I reinstalled again from the beginning."
how is it that you can't log in
"cool and very helpful, hopefully the books can be complemented again"
good
Why can't my ipusnas application be opened? Please help

"I swear it's so hard to log in, it makes me uncomfortable, sorry I unfollowed"
"actually, like Ipusnas. Lots of good books. but how come lately when opening the app it's slow? that is, the buffering is long. even though the network is OK, if you open other applications it's also smooth. Just ipusnas :( and when I was about to borrow a book, the account logged out by itself"
bad app...

"If the book has been downloaded, the regular book is not on the loan list, so you have to download it again if you want to read it"
its loading time. just finish the quota!!!
"it's actually good, it's a shame it doesn't look attractive and the error continues, hopefully in the future it can be fixed"
"Sorry, I uninstalled the application because it says network is timeout trs, if it doesn't, it just logs out itself. It's a shame that the books are good and I've copied many of the links to the books I wanted to read (because there wasn't an option to read later, so I copied the links). Hopefully when I install this great application again, the condition is much better. tq :-)"
"good app, but error too often"
"why after updating why is it so difficult to access it?? suddenly logging out by yourself, trying to log in again becomes even more difficult"
"always just network timeout, why is that?"
why the error can't connect to server and can't fetch dls ?
can't open the apk
"there are still problems, one of which is the internet connection, even though the internet here is quite good, but sometimes the application can't run/access properly. Need to continue to develop this application again.."
"can't download books, the signal always timeouts, even though it uses a wifi signal, please fix it immediately"
"good application, the book collection is quite complete, it's just that it often fails to login, even though the signal is stable"
"greetings literacy. it would be nice to improve the performance again. because I or even other users also experience the same rights, namely lag and errors when logging in via PC or Android... please developers make it easier for us to read this digital era, what's wrong with setting aside the state treasury for national literacy?.."
"How come this is buffering the site, come on, cooperate. I want to read this book, but I can't open it, I've reinstalled it several times but it still doesn't work. How do you want to read this book?"
"the apps are really good, better now delete the klean games (mobile legend, ff, pubg, dragon nest M, laplace M, Ragnarok, pou etc wkwk) and start reading. It's no less fun, you know, what else is reading a novel, it's really really good XD"
Every log in error. How do you borrow the book if you can't log in? üòÇüòÇ

Ô∏è
great app....
"Often unable to log in, lost loan history data, and various other problems"
"The app is good. There are favorite novels, there are also textbooks that I need."
Thank you for making this application so that I can read a lot of books without having to spend money to buy or go to the public library. My reading list has increased because of the large collection of books at Ipusnas. It's just that this application server is terrible. often logs out on its own and downloaded books are lost. Please sincerely that there is a system improvement. This is very much needed. Thank you Ô∏è
good
"the application is easy to error, all borrowed books are lost."
ipusnas is very good for helping me find references to complete my final project. but it is better to add more educational books to make it easier for users if they want to find books related to education and teaching. thank you ipusnas üòä
"it's still an error, hurry up and fix it"
why do you often get errors? although the network is good. time has to be reinstalled and then you can use it
"He said he wanted to increase interest in reading, after installing the application, I don't know what was asked, it was difficult to read books."
"hello sis. Why is this when I install it, it's hard to log in, right? even though using fb and gmail it's also difficult to enter."
"This app really helps. But I beg you, why do errors and lags often occur. When I'm logged in I often log out myself in the application. Sometimes the book can't load, even though the internet is smooth. PLEASE REPAIR IMMEDIATELY"
"This error isn't good, haha, I'm sorry I installed it"
exciting
hard to log in. .waiting too long
"the collection of books is lacking, especially for translated books, only to find a few even though the outside books are very good. On the positive side, it is quite helpful rather than going wild by reading unreliable readings."
"Actually this application is very helpful in finding books, but sometimes I like to log out myself and it's really hard to log in again"
"why every time I log in there is an error, right?"
"logout frequently. when logging in using email, you have to set a new password (because using the old password will always fail). when you log in, the loan history is lost, the profile is lost, everything is gone. please improve the performance again"
"Very helpful. However, it is often problematic. Please fix it soon, Thank you."
"kaaaa, why is it so hard for me to borrow a book? even though the quota has been updated and the signal is also a lot even though there is still time to read. can i have your solution?"
"I think the application is not good. frequent errors etc. Sorry, I only give 1 star as an evaluation material from the provider. I hope that the quality of the application and the quantity of the books can be improved, considering that Indonesia's literacy rate is still minimal"
"why is it so hard to login? I really hope a lot for this application. please improve, thank you."
"I like this application, it's just that it annoys me to have to keep logging in, then logging in is also difficult. Sometimes it lags too. so pls read. Please fix it, I really like reading"
bgs
"How come I'm logging in with my old Facebook account, it doesn't keep connecting.."
"there are still many books that have not been released here, please include the book Bumi Manusia by Pramoedya Ananta Toer. because the book is expensive and a lot of knowledge can be obtained there. help..."
"please immediately fix some errors and loading that takes too long and sometimes this application comes out on its own, so that many millennials use this app"
why can't the application be used to register üôè
My only suggestion is that there should be a way to save books that have not been downloaded or that there are books that will be downloaded. because when we download only 3 books
awesome
can't enter. I wonder why?
"please fix it, loading takes a long time when logging in and often crashes"
"Please fix it immediately regarding account problems that often go out on their own üôè but the rest is very helpful, thank you."
not good at stability. accounts often log out on their own. data often error. please fix
can't open
"positive: the equipment is okay, very helpful, negative: the interface is not good, can't be used when offline like Wattpad, then the books are very limited to borrow (the queue has to be queued) hopefully it can be better"
very difficult to login / register.
"I want to register, I can't use Facebook & Gmail too"
I give 5 stars because I can read books without having to go to the library. just error sometimes. please fix
"This application is great, making the habit of reading books in a practical package. Unfortunately, my device often closes by itself, asks to re-login over and over, fails to log in using Facebook over and over, even when the book I was reading suddenly closed itself, when I had to re-login suddenly it wasn't on the loan shelf. Please fix the various shortcomings, don't let interest in reading decrease again because of the application error."
"Why is the application often down? Suddenly I log out myself, and when I want to log in it's really hard"
why is it taking so long to get in?
still error
Why can't I even login when I log in? it says please wait but wait for hours I can't login
very helpful. just please improve the search and categorization system again.
"since there is ipusnas, i can read any book without having to go to the library. ipusnas is very useful for me."
"Yesterday I wanted to read a book, how come I suddenly logged out, and I tried to log in again, how come I can't?"
"really really like the application... it really gives a solution for us, the wallet is just barely enough to buy a book... he he he often gets errors, please fix it.."
"bug, but still like"
"this application is really good, because I can access the booth books that are sold on playbooks at quite expensive prices but on Ipusnas I can access them for free, thanks ipusnas Ô∏èüòòüòä"
"I was really helped by this application, it's just that there are still many shortcomings, for example problems logging in and downloading books, the number of books is still small, and the lack of functions in the application that should exist in the reading application, but overall is good"
"This application really helps me to add insight. Many books are needed, without having to buy, you can borrow them."
good app
"With this application, I can realize my dream of reading free books and the collection continues to grow. Thank you!"
very useful. literacy culture can skyrocket.
frequent error
very helpful
why can't I log in and then the book category also reloads? I've uninstalled it and it's still the same huhu
"How come I can't login since yesterday? network timeouts continue. I've uninstalled and then installed again, still the same."
"Very good in building the intelligence of the nation's children and continue to improve its quality, yes."
It's easy there are always additional books every day. Mantul budjank :D
"just installed, want to enter but can't be asked, please just wait like that"
"I've downloaded it and registered, right.. all of a sudden it's been 2 weeks and I even asked to register again.. and the collection of books that I borrowed suddenly wasn't there.. please fix it again üôè greetings literacy"
very good application and it helps if the quality of the application can be improved
"I really like this application but please add more books, especially the novels"
"I like the application, I hope that there are more books needed by students in the library's collection, for example, I have a hard time finding books majoring in library science in this application, even if there are only a few, Mr. Sulistiyo Basuki's book is not in the book list, and hopefully the features The borrowing is just abolished, so it's easier for readers to download the e-book... I'm sure if this application made it easier to get e-books and e-journals it would be more enjoyable for college students..."
Thank you iPusnas. Please update and reproduce novels and fantasy books :)
Subhanallah hopefully with this application can increase the spirit of reading the Indonesian generation. thanks so much iPusnas is very helpful
"I'm looking for a book from Slameto and Moh. sura (characteristics of students in the learning process) bandung: media coaching, 2000. Is there any?"
steadypp

"The generation likes to read the current style,, goodüòç"
Very advanced but a bit slow please be better...
"yes, there is no error, thank you ipusnas"
"The application is very good, the book is also quite complete.. But admin please fix it because sometimes there are errors.."
"whatever happens, from now on I choose Ipusnas as the best partner in literacy, I'm often annoyed with Ipusnas, but from now on I want to learn to understand the feelings of Ipusnas. please help"
"In fact, the application is good and very helpful, it's just that please make regular repairs because errors often occur. Books that have been borrowed often do not appear on the shelves, even though I have followed the existing lending procedures. At night, the application is very difficult to access. I can understand if I can't borrow books at night, but I just borrowed books in the afternoon, why is the book not on the shelf at night? They say the limit for borrowing is 3 days, but not yet 24 hours the book is gone"
"I like ipusnas, but now it keeps failing, can't be accessed"
very often error
why does load time appear unable to retrieve data from server and no DLS?
"A very useful application, hopefully in the future it will be better"
reduce the error
amazing really really helped me in finding references.
"what the hell, why can't it be opened"
"This has often happened, please improve it more so that our society is smarter. ipusnas the books are very good"
"Ipusnas often has errors, often logs out by itself until you have to log in again many times, please fix it, please! Ipusnas books are also mostly old books, bored, that's all. But, Ipusnas is indeed the best. Thank you ipusnas. Later when Ipusnas is fixed, I will add the rating"
why cant when you want to enter? (:
why the application again? Why can't I login using my email?
the book is quite a lot but can't load....
"How come it's lagging, my c'mon, I want to read, can't download. fix the bug next update, bro, hopefully iPusnas will be more successful."
How come it can't be opened? Yes
Is this app down? because I can't go in.
"after the update why is it so hard to log-in, and even if the 4G network is good, the network timeouts, and sometimes the book data doesn't exist. please fix"
"with ipusnas makes it easier to read,,"
"I was really happy at first, but 2 days later there were a lot of problems.. Like time out, lag, can't log in and all kinds of things.. I uninstalled 4 times :( But even so, this app is actually very helpful and useful, the only error is that the problem..hopefully it will be fixed as soon as possible.."
"First error, long loading, failed to login. That's all I'm tired. Ô∏è"
why can't the app be opened?
"actually very helpful and very useful. but why does the error occur more often please fix the application so it doesn't hang often, thank you"
thank you very much very helpful. although not all titles are here.
"Even though the application is really good, why is it getting errors now? Please as soon as possible to fix the problem, so that it can be accessed again."
disappointed can't log in. please help how to log in
useful application but often error.
"the application is very good because it is very helpful for finding references to scientific books, please improve the application again because in the past when I used the application it was very good but now there are many errors, difficult to log in, etc."
"the story can't be opened, it keeps getting errors too, when you want to open the apps, it's really hard to beg to be fixed again"
"It takes a long time to load... Speed ‚Äã‚Äãit up a bit, and the worst thing is that Ipusnas likes ""EROR"""
"it's good, but like suddenly the connection fails, uh, you know, out of account.. where else to look for books for assignments.. you all get lost.. want to log in again, you fail.. why are you ipusnass :""( even though i like it"
"the application error is muluuuu, even though I still need it, how about the programmer?"
"I gave it 2 first because of the application error and if I can fix it as soon as possible, I'll consider giving it 5 stars"
"The application is really good for poor students who want to read high quality books, but why can't I log in again, hiks, the network timeout continues, min. please fix it soon"
incomplete book :(
"please check, today ipusnas is down, right?"
I updated the app so it can't be opened. network error keeps
can't load server. What happen. why?
I un-installed the application first. Because every time I open the application I have to log in again and again and the last time this application error cannot login. Though this application is very good for people who like to read. Please fix soon. Thank you Ipusnas. :)
"it's too bad the application can't be opened, there is only a star image"
This application is very good .. but there are still some problems that still need to be fixed .. Like the process of borrowing & downloading books that often have problems and some options that often can't be opened .. so .. PLEASE UPDATE AGAIN ..
good for those who like to read
Goodüëç
the application is difficult to enter
"A very useful application, especially for those who like and like to read."
often error
"Why is it so hard to log in? At first I logged in but suddenly I had to log in again :'( I tried resetting my password but the data is not valid and when I try again, it's still hard to log in"
"very helpful for the community, but the book collection is incomplete, and old books are also not available"
very easy to add insight
disappointing
"This application really helps me in studying, but why is it that every time I open the apps I'm always asked to login via email or facebook. And when I've logged in, often the book that I want to borrow is not saved or can't be opened please improve this app more üôè"
"thanks for fixing it, i like it"
"At first it was ok, good. But over time, this application starts to get weird, every time you want to continue reading, you have to log in again and log in again. Just downloaded, 2 hours later I want to continue reading, I have to download it again, that's right, this quota is wasteful. It's disappointing, it's a pain, because it's already done reading, the IT department isn't ready yet."
good
can not be opened
love it
"paray, can't open the application, turn can be opened can't login"
"hello, I like this app but why do it often get errors, it says an error has occurred on the server or something. When I uninstalled it, I installed it again, it's still the same even though the book is complete"". Please update as soon as possible, thanks üòä"
"Previously, this app was fine. But, why every time I open the application it always says ""no data from the server and no DLS"" what do you mean? In fact, I really like this app because it's really really helpful."
"please answer my question. why after downloading I can't open it and it says ""can't retrieve data from the server and there's no DLS, close the application"" like that why please help"
I am grateful for the presence of the iPusnas application because I can read more books whenever I want. Thank you iPusnas!
"the apk is good.. it can help students find the source of the book they want to quote.. but one, why is it so difficult to log in... even though the internet connection is good.."
"Sir, please optimize the application again, I often have problems logging out myself. from the app when you want to open it again. Even though this is a light application right??? And also when you open it, it takes a long time, sir."" This application is very useful for increasing the knowledge of the nation's children who live in areas where libraries are difficult to reach."
The performance is sluggish. Please fix it so that it is more convenient to choose a collection of books and read them
Why today suddenly this application can not be used. Even though it's really important for me to read the book I've downloaded. Disappointed.
"please fix the feature bro. it often lags, but today access is really difficult. I want to find a book for reference, so I can't."
frequent application errors. login keeps failing.
"Applications are very helpful in enriching literacy, especially for students, but there are still many lags and errors when entering. Very annoying. Sometimes a book that has been downloaded has to be downloaded again even though the loan period has not yet expired. Please, the borrowing period of the book is adjusted to the sheet. Because there are some books with very many pages. Please enrich the books again. Lots of novels and comics. To stimulate Indonesian children's interest in reading. Thank you."
"can't log in, how do you do this? I want to read a borrowed book but I can't. I have to log in again but I can't. please fix this app is very good"
"iPusnas is a cool application and is very helpful for this knowledge misqien friend, but unfortunately it often crashes, suddenly the application exits and loading really can't open :( please fix it"
cool....can be read wherever you are
CAN'T LOGIN please fix it
ok
man
"the application often crashes. likes to log out by myself, books that have been borrowed suddenly can't be opened, it's hard to log in and the display of the book can't be adjusted to the font size. please further develop the quality so that it can be more useful"
So cool
basically i like it :))))
sad can't see activity :(
"It looks stiff. maybe need some more UI development. the system is quite good, but the problem is that the book borrowing limit is only 3 days. maybe it can be added to 1 week or 5 days. the book collection is also not complete, and the number of copies for one book is still too few. But it's good enough, there are also many good books here. My suggestion is to collaborate with publishers and IKAPI, in order to increase the collection and book titles."
"Incomplete, no book on Physiotherapy"
good... very helpful
Very good .. but there is no grouping of books .. must be tired of scrolling to get the type of book that is liked/wanted
very helpful
I hope I can find more references because I'm lazy to go around looking for a complete library of books
"this application really helped me become a love of reading, at first I didn't like reading but now I like reading because of the ipusnas application..."
very good application. save pocket money. can read for free. love it so much..
"Thank you in advance, with this apk, you don't have to bother going to the library. I'm a little complaining that the pictures in the tutorial book are blurry, so I can't continue. rich in yuni sugiarti's java book, etc. please fix. thx"
"ipusnas, an application for reading books. Hopefully with this application it can increase the reading interest of the Indonesian people. Thank you Ipusnas. 3 stars first, there are still many bugs regarding literacy. ."
good
"good hobbies for reading teenagers, housewives, and all walks of life can be channeled through this application. Reading opens a window to the world!"
there should be school children's textbooks
"It really helped me.. It's really cool, this app will regret it if you don't install it"
"Thank God, it is really useful for people to look for sources of knowledge today with the help of the free digital era, my advice is that this application service can be made easier so that ordinary people can enjoy this service and always keep it updated for the sake of advancing Indonesia. greetings ""FREE WORK"" from village children"
"many times the error downloads often fails even though it's only been closed for a while, a notification often appears ""iPunsnas has stopped"""
very helpful
Still haven't tried
That's great.. a lot of knowledge can be easily obtained.
okay
"for a book reading application, this app asks too many permissions to the android device. and need to login anyway. bad"
"Honestly, I just found out that there is a digital library application. It's really very helpful and facilitates our literacy, who don't have a village library."
"there are still many bugs, the search word must be appropriate and the display is not attractive, please improve it further and I really appreciate this application is good for educating the nation :)"
very helpful
"the cake is good, I give it 5 stars anyways for apk it's difficult, especially until you can enter PS, there must be a lot of sacrifice, right üòÇ"
"The application is very helpful, only now the books are limited, what I was looking for directly, the answer was not found, previously found, what was the solution, sir?"
ok
"This application is actually very useful for millennials like me to divert from dependence on social media, but why is the loading so slow, it's hard to register."
"every book that is borrowed but when you want to open it immediately comes out by itself, the ram is stable.. my cellphone has 2GB of RAM, the application is still lacking"
"Good intentions but bad execution can be seen in this application. The collection of books is actually complete and even though the borrowing does not take long, it is natural because it is free. but very disturbed about responsibility and a very bad user interface for a PlayStore application class. please fix for next version. greetings literacy"
"Why do you have to borrow a complicated book, it's best to read it right away, then if you don't want to download and login, don't force it. just reading it's complicated to use this apk, it's better to go to PU for real."
"Sorry, why can't I log in? really sad. because I can't log in and I certainly can't borrow booksüò≠üò≠üò≠"
üòÇ
üëçüëç
"Why can't I log in, I don't like it, I'm tired of downloading, but I can't log in, I can't read, I just spent my quota"

"BEST APPLICATION OF ALL TIME THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS GREAT APPLICATION. BUT I ALSO HAVE SUGGESTIONS FOR MORE COMPLETE BOOK TITLES, SHOWING BOOK SUGGESTIONS TO READ BASED ON THE NUMBER OF READERS/RATING/ETC., EASILY SEARCHING BOOK TITLES BY INCLUDING EVERYTHING RELATED TO THE SEARCH WITH THESE SEARCH. THANK YOU."
üòç Good~üòÜ I can read books without having to go all the way to the National Library. This app is great because books can be read offline. Thank God there are no ads either. I am grateful that I can now read Iwan Simatupang's Pilgrimage from this application. Thank you üòäüëçüòâüòò

please complete the book :)
"very happy with this application, very helpful in doing assignments and thesis, looking for references and adding other knowledge, both formal and informal. thank you ipusnas"
This is why I want to log in for a long time
"an amazing application, very helpful easily in finding references even though it is not completely complete. just a suggestion for the loan period, it would be better to add the time to provide flexibility to the reader, especially for books over 500 pages. thank you"
"This application is very good, but there are many bugs, which make it difficult to enter, there are often ""unknown error"" notifications, please fix them immediately."
"the android version is ok. the windows version is quite heavy and takes a long time to load when searching and opening ebooks. when searching and then scrolling down past 2 pages, there must be an error."
"Please, if you want to log in, you don't need to log in all the time, just log in once, it takes a long time when you log in using fb, then you don't respond using email, so I want to uninstall it please fix it again, it doesn't open for a few days and I'm told to log in again, the same error, so I can't read the book"
What's the difference between eCatalog and Popular when you borrow a book?
Oops this flaw.. have to login again
"just love 3. because there is no guide and the loan limit is only 2 days. input sy ""don't make an application if you bear"". good job. because the response was good, I added 5 stars. thanks. nice day."
"I like to exit the application myself, so the book is lacking."
Good.
WL
ok
"the app likes to go out on its own. When I borrowed a book, it suddenly came out on its own, I tried to get it out again. then when I want to log in again, it doesn't respond. please improve the service"

Thank you so much from me for reading my complaints"
OK

"It's a good application even I really like this application, the drawback is that the collection needs to be added and please add a copy feature so that readers can copy quotes from the ipusnas application."
"Min, this application rarely updates, even though there are still many bugs and so on. Has cooperation with application developers been terminated or what? litteraly this application is very useful, but there are some errors that make it uncomfortable"

Online library This is very helpful

"this application is very helpful for me who is a student, but there are shortcomings in this application where the genre of books and the types are still scattered, it is better if the books are grouped so that they are easy to find"
Okay
the book is incomplete.
"bring me closer to the library, thank you."
wow amazing
"Great ... if all the libraries in the provinces and districts have used the library, it will be easier to access and find books that are needed as additional knowledge? congratulations to i pusnas. hopefully more progress."

read thousands of free ebooks? yes IPUSNAS application dong
very helpful
"The iPusnas application has gotten better since I uninstalled this application in my first year of college. Thank you for making this application even better, I feel very helped by the collection of scientific books and entertained by the fiction books. But in my opinion this application still needs to be tidied up again. It is better for books to be classified/equipped with a search feature based on the type of book so that it is easier for users to find reading materials of certain types at random. Greetings literacy"

this application is very helpful to educate the nation ‚ù§
"Bismillah, hopefully useful"
"already good. The collection of books is also quite complete. I just don't know why it often lags, it takes a long time to load. and at that time, as I recall, I had logged in and it was a long time since I had to log in again because I deleted this application. it can only fit on wi-fi even though it's pretty good at home (webtoon and wattpad can be opened). one more thing, extend the loan period. For me, who was still studying for 3 days, it was very short, especially if I borrowed a fairly thick book."
Mashallah amazing
"I like to suddenly exit my own account and when I log in I can't. It's a bit inconvenient because it could have been that I was still reading a book, but apparently I couldn't open it. please fix again, thank you."
"Thank you, this application is very helpful, literacy greetings."
"If possible, there is a place for free download of the ebook, so if we borrow the book, we can save it on our cellphone."
"I've tried it and it really helped, but when I was about to enter the application, I was told to log in again... but I can't.."
for the sake of reason and conscience. good
very helpful
Cool :) Really helpful for us Indonesian students who want to know how the outside window looks like hehe

"the application is very good. but when I update to the new version, how come it's slow and tends not to load the download even though the signal is good, it's night time again. but thanks, very helpful program."

Very helpful in the intellectual life of the nation. Make it easier for us to find references.
"Good application, I can find the e-book I want here, hopefully many will be interested in reading here and hopefully in the future it can be even better"
"it looks easy, although there are still improvements to be made here and there, the presence of this application is very helpful. it would be even better if the collection of books was reproduced. Thus, users get greater satisfaction. thank you, good luck!"
Cannot download books. Frequent crashes

Even though this morning it still worked, in the afternoon it suddenly couldn't be used, every time I tried it always got an error. I tried to uninstall and now I want to try to reinstall hopefully I can"

"Indonesia needs a generation that likes to read, and this is a very good innovation. Because young people today prefer to play cellphones, with this application hopefully it can increase interest in reading Indonesian youth. STUNNING üëçüëç"
"A very good application, providing the experience of borrowing books with just a few easy steps, even just one tap, occasionally feeling nostalgic for the college days that excitedly went to the National Library and confused about choosing what books to borrow, and waiting for the books to be delivered. It's really a very useful application even though you can only borrow 3 books and even then sometimes it's not finished and it's been returned, thank you"
mantabss.. hopefully useful

good
"i like this app. but it's a shame that this application has entered the account, it often exits itself and has to be re-entered. It's hard to read. even though before it was very easy. but now it's really hard. even though it is urgently needed a book that has been used."
"why can't I just register, is this application paid, even though I have difficulty downloading it again and again but still can't register"
Very nice
incomplete reference
cool
baguuuuus
this app really helped me
what's with this app? why always error and don't want to use? what's the problem with this app? so much.
very helpful app
Why can't I log in?
just try
"The book is quite complete and easy to use and has complete features. One thing that I think needs to be improved is the ""browse"" feature. When I want to search for a book with a title (example: xyz), the result is a book with another very different title (example: abc) and often I have to try using different keywords to find the book I'm looking for. . Thank you."
I hope it can be useful for many people
"The application often crashes, every time I want to open it, I am told to log in again. slow too. even though it's very helpful, but often there are errors so I often bang my cellphone because I'm angry"
the application likes errors so it's lazy to open it
helpful and useful application. just need further development that is even better. don't be complacent
"very helpful in the ""DiLan"" era"
"Thank you Ipusnas, I hope that it will contribute to the prosperity of the Indonesian people to be aware of reading and not to stutter."
"please fix it, even though I have logged in many times but it says not logged in yet,"
baguuuuuuuuuus
Easy way to increase literacy
good. but if it's been uninstalled then reinstalled sometimes it's an error
app often hangs
suddenly logout re-login can't
"very helpful, but please add a feature to scroll pages to make it faster."
"very useful, thank you very much ipusnas :)"
"This application is very, very good, for those of us who like to read. only, after about 2 weeks, to login with the same account is no longer possible. so we have to change to a new account. I've used 4 accounts to login. now to read again can not. please fix it asap..."
very useful application..
simple and very helpful
"Every time I want to log in it fails ""muluüò•"
help
reasonable
I'm having a hard time logging in
very good
the application is very good because it can give access to anyone to increase literacy. This application will be even better if the book borrowing period can be extended and the book collection is added. The addition of features such as a 'wishlist' like on Google Play will also be very helpful for readers. Thank you for your dedication in creating this application. Hopefully the readers' suggestions can be an impetus for the development of the Ipusnas application.
"a very useful application, the choice of books is also many and good, iPusnas favorite! but unfortunately there are so many errors, either because the network is not good or there are problems from the system, so it's a bit annoying when you want to read. hopefully iPusnas will be even better. greetings literacy"
Suddenly an error can't open the application even though I really need it
"even though yesterday I was able to enter suddenly ""the error is not clear, isn't it?"
Okay
Really good
"after the update, access is a bit difficult... keep logging in. please fix üôè"
plz fix it so it's easy to login in the application.
Why is it hard for me to borrow and download? even though my network is good for opening other apps too
"Please fix the system immediately. It is felt, this Ipusnas application has experienced problems for a long time, but is slow in handling. Hopefully the problem will be resolved quickly, and we can use it again as usual."
Cool.
"it's okay, but the books are not complete... please add the collection of books"
It's been very good. But please fix some network related errors ! I'll add a star later.
"It's good, but please complete the collection again"
Very helpful

"Very useful, so it's easier to add knowledge and insight"
"cool, very helpful"
aware of wanting to read and learn that the world is full of mysteries.. can help knowing by reading. thank you
"Thank you, glad to have iPusnas... it's like bringing a library into my hands"
"good, but better if there is no duration of borrowing. so you don't download often"
the coolest application in the digital era so that everyone likes to read very helpful
very useful
"Thank you, very helpful, the application is still not perfect and there are still many errors such as when the search is just blank, enthusiasm for the National Library, Hopefully it can be even better"
good
"How come there are often lags and errors, min @perpusnas even though the application is cool.... Weaknesses: frequent Lags and errors. Search feature is not optimal, sometimes it doesn't match what is typed.. Pros: useful, speeds up access to information, etc. Please fix it immediately min. Thank you"
Very helpful application.. Thank you
very helpful
"Make it easier for people to find a variety of quality books. Suggestion, that deposit collections and manuscript repositories are included."

thank you ipusnas digital library. very helpful .. even though some of my colleagues are in remote villages they can still read through this application and the network that has started is adequate. although there are still many obstacles in the field. I give permission to share this application with other colleagues. greetings library wassalam
"Good good, I like reading, I was told by the teacher to download this, very useful, I give 5 stars"

a very useful application for the so-called millennial generation. But please fix it when registration is very difficult.
"can borrow and read books anytime and anywhere, cool, hope in the future I can search books not only by title but also by author"
Help me in finding any book
Sangar

good recomnd
cool even though sometimes the server is down
incomplete book
"The percentage of reading books is slow and sometimes inappropriate, even though the books read have been completed but the percentage is still at 20%. Maybe in the future this can be improved again. I still appreciate and give 5 stars."
"I can't log in the application, it's very difficult if it's a free one"
"Often have problems, login error, can't see loan history, slow..."
Can't borrow an unknown error book and it's written
since the update entered the application it took too long... the loading took too long even though the internet was running smoothly
why does it have to be updated?
good
the application often has errors and many books are not available / incomplete
"Good application but often errors and logs out by itself, when you want to re-enter, you can't. Please fix"
great.. but it still crashes all of a sudden
very helpful for my thesis
very good
is ipusnas a paid application with money
"why does my library have an error and want to go out on its own, bro, please fix it..."
So five stars
good
OK
"iPusnas helped me get e-books for books that are no longer available in the market, but I feel they are still not optimal: 1. Can't the loan period be extended to 2 weeks or at least 1 week? 2. I think the loan history feature is very helpful, especially when the loan only takes 3 days. So readers don't have to look for books from scratch again."
I just found out that the National Library is online. really worth it. Improve the features and make it more attractive for all ages
very good.. now reading is so much easier.. hopefully more and more people like to read
very helpful
His books are super special and very special. Read the Secret Book of Sustenance Magnets .
"Alhamdulillah, good application. very helpful. but why is it a bit difficult to register? keep repeating. When I want to read a book too, it's hard. why does the application stop on its own when you use it? And I hope you can add more school books please. thanks."

"the ipusnas application is good, so I am diligent in reading but if I want to open this application every time why is it so difficult to enter the application, there is always an unknown error, why is the application like this"
Slow
"why the network error keeps not being able to borrow, and can't login"
"it's been updated, why did you add a bug"
why can't log in
"the app is good. sometimes it helps me to find reference material for lectures. however, several times this application experienced errors. like, the queue and loan history are not listed, even though my internet connection is good."
Very helpful. Huge collection of books to read
very helpful
"the national library application is very helpful in educating the Indonesian people. but please for ministry class applications, both android and desktop versions are still flawed and have many problems, so please fix it because honestly this application is very cool if there are not many obstacles such as lag, errors, and so on. greetings literacy"
why is it so hard to register?
"How come I can't open Ipusnas? Since then, the password has been logged in"

"if you can add the reading history menu, sir/madam"
I found many good things
"There are still many errors, and the book is incomplete"
"difficulty logging in, always error"
why is there no feature to mark last read? so you have to scroll down again to find the last page read it would be nice if you added this feature to make it easier for readers
Why the app can't be downloaded
quite helpful to increase knowledge instead of buying. keep improving
thanks make it easy to learn anywhere :)
"this application is very good. very helpful. Especially in general books and novels. but I'm confused, because some of the titles in the search show the book, but when I search through the author's name it doesn't appear. just a little bit. Because they are confused looking for titles one by one, they don't go directly to the author. How is that?? Thank you üôè"
i like this app. many famous books that can be borrowed here. I hope the book collection continues to grow.
It's really hard to log in again if you've already used it to log in!!!
"All Indonesians are required to install iPusnas. make your sophisticated cellphone as a means to add insight as well. With this application, it is also good for growing interest in reading Indonesian citizens who are relatively low. Hopefully iPusnas can help those who are lazy to go to bookstores or libraries, or maybe those who don't have money to buy books. And the most important thing for those who are lazy to read so that they are diligent in reading. Reading has many benefits. So install this app üëçüëç"
"Suddenly the application can't be opened, it's turn already open, the account has logged out by itself, when I want to enter the email it doesn't appear on the list, it says, I tried all existing emails but it still doesn't work, even though there is a new book downloaded after waiting in line for a long time, I can't could."
good
I'm very easy to do tgs
", when clicking on a genre category, all books appear so it's easy to make references"
With this I feel happy to be able to read all kinds of books. but why lately unknown error often? It's a shame that a reading application is this good but it often crashes.
please fix the server min. it has been inaccessible for several days. just ignite emotions
hade
"thank you because this application helped me a lot in accessing books easily.... it's just a shame that the application often stops because of network problems, even though other applications run smoothly. hopefully in the future this application can work even better and there will always be updates for the latest books..... Literacy greetings"
great spaceguru
I feel happy with the various references in it
"There are still unknown errors, the list of books does not appear, the login error even closes itself even though the wifi network at my house is quite fast, and the memory condition of my cellphone is still loose. But there is still more time where I can enjoy the books that I borrow, for free too. Thank you"
very simple but so little book in the ipusnas
good
"please update the data, min, books about the history of cinema and cinema in particular, if updated, I will give 5 stars"
"why does it keep loading, it's often an error too."
"Min, the application keeps getting errors, it's really hard to log in. Please fix it asap."

"Why do you like to logout yourself now? If you don't use fast wifi, you can't log in again. So you can't read a book?"
Very Good
I hope the data stays safe
Continue! Upgrade! being away from the library or not having money to buy books are no longer excuses for not reading books.
"ipusnas is really good for those of you who like to read books but are lazy to buy books, besides, if it's in an application like this, we don't have to bother carrying books because smart phones are items that are always near us, so this application is really recommended."
"I like IPUSNAS, because the search process is fast and there are many choices of books to look for"

very good and I like that there is a library application that can read books Ô∏èüòçüòçüòç .... but the collection is not that much it seems.. and the application still needs improvement because it is not too comfortable.. keep up the spirit of the national library to develop its application.. for sure can be much better in the future üòçüòçüòçüíôüíô
"If indeed the server provider can't afford the maintenance or can't fulfill the service level agreement, it's better to replace it, min, that's right! the official national library, when you have app development, there are so many problems, private access is better"
great for seeking new insights. the application is very easy to run. the only problem is the incoming connection and the return of the book
very helpful
"Why do you often get errors, bro, already logged in, remove the apk, the account is out and the book that was borrowed is also gone.."

"Actually I like this application, it is very helpful and the books available are quite a lot and complete. However, I really regret that, when it's updated, it's even more difficult to access the book, it takes a long time to load and often fails. network timeout continues, even though my network is fine. If you can, please fix it, so that borrowing access is faster."

"Sorry, I'm currently working on a research proposal, to be honest, iPusnas is really helpful in finding references. But sometimes the existing books rarely have information on where the book was published or made, so I can't include the book I got from iPusnas and it will end up with plagiarism later if I don't include it, if I can complete the identity of the book, starting from author, year of publication, title, city and publisher"
it gets worse after updating it often comes out by itself

Please fix the server error often..
"please for the ipusmas admin, the application is fixed after the upgrade it doesn't get better it gets worse .... I will increase the star rating as long as it doesn't come out on its own. 4G network and wifi are the same. Previously the application was good, but why did it get worse after the upgrade?"

"Min, please, please take care of the application more. why rarely update even though many bugs are scattered. Now I can't even read books. every time you want to open the book, the app closes itself. Besides that, please increase the number of books every week. Thank you"
How come it can't be installed??? Since then I can't
good makes it easy to get knowledge easily

"often bugged, every time I open I keep logging in. please fix it soon."
"Anyway, Ipusnas is the best! There are a lot of new features, I like it, I like it. But why are some features not working? For example, the 3 point button in the right corner, if you click it nothing appears, and there are others. Now also the up and down command bars are very easy to appear without being ordered, when scrolling the command bar also appears. Pretty annoying hehe."
"I enjoy reading, and this application is very helpful. but unfortunately, often errors. often, difficult to log in. repeatedly, using a different cellphone, can't even log in. Sometimes, I can log in, I want to download the book, I can't. plz dear, improve the quality."
"Good, it really helps to improve reading literacy, but the book collection must be complete, including past history books."
"Sorry, some time ago I reinstalled my ipusnas application, but couldn't login. Now, indeed I can login again, but why can't my profile in my email account appear as before? Loan history, profile, etc. clean, like a newbie account. Can my profile be restored as before?"
incomplete for the course.
"Often when I open I suddenly log out myself and have to log in all the time. Even though it's a waste of time, it's okay, hopefully in the future it can be better. Anyway, I really like this application, all must have it. Thank you ipusnas, hopefully the novel collection will always be updated, hehe."

Why can't I even log in?
"Sis, admin, tq for the feedback, but it's still not working, bro, to borrow books, log out automatically, I have to register again... help sis"
The idea to make this application is very good. but the execution is okay. where just logging in is always an error either logib via FB or Via Email. please fix
Do you like going out alone? So login multiple times
"very good application. but it needs updating again, especially on the server where errors often occur"
cool to be able to get quality reading for free
"Greetings to IPusnas, sorry I previously gave three stars to the IPusnas application. Because I'm having problems logging in and logging in to my gmail account and Facebook account, please solve it. Then also for the collection of History and Literature books, please add more, if this problem can be solved later, I'm happy to add another star, thank you, greetings users."

"good! almost all favorite books are there. addictive. I just want to suggest this, please add a special search feature for the publisher's name. this will make it easier for readers (like me) who like to forget the title and author's name."
"The apk is good but the searching feature is lacking, please improve itüôèüôè"
I just promoted this application on my social media because I thought it would be useful for my friends who would write a thesis. but when you want to log in again you can't... ouch
"assalamuaalaikum, I want to ask.. every time I want to open the Ipusnas application, why do I have to log in again, okay?"
"Good app! Suggestions, if possible add a ""save book:"" or ""favorite book"" or ""collection of books"" icon, so that you can easily find or reread books that have been previously read"
why unknown then anyway?üò≠

no more confused looking for books
good
"great...the book collection is also good...a very good application for introducing today's children to bookstores...if I didn't search on the internet, maybe I wouldn't know this app...maybe it lacks promotion? maybe.... but what is clear is BOOK IS WINDOW OF THE WORLD..."
"now why does my account go out by itself, and it's hard to log in via facebook or email. until now i haven't been able to read books on ipusnas, even though the connection is smooth."
incomplete
slow app. It's hard to log in and the books that have been borrowed suddenly disappear
"good job, increase it"
"please fix the application again I want to open the book but the server keeps getting errors, I think because of the internet I checked the package and refreshed it still doesn't work"
Very useful...hopefully it will forever be the wealth of the nation's national digital collection to advance people's literacy.

why can't login via fb?
"why is the unknown error so long, I'm just happy to have it installed, eh, php is also the end"
always the reason is there is no network even though the wifi is fast and opens all applications smoothly
why do you have to log in when you go out and want to log in again and the login is difficult several times an unknown error appears ....
"Min, why is ipusnas now often getting errors and can't even log in? Initially it went smoothly without any obstacles to login and borrow books."
Very useful for those who like to read
"annoying! the app often logs out on its own if you exit the app! every time you open it, you have to log in first. when the email and password have been filled in, still can't log in!!!! move! please make it easy!

I've tried every way, from logging out of the account to uninstalling, installing the app again, it still doesn't work. even though the internet is open to others, it's just smooth, I can't use wifi. I can't use a data package either. sad.. even though I really want to read it now. Usually you can, although sometimes you can't, but it won't take long to do it again. this doesn't even work.. give 3 stars first. if there is no new error, then more"

really cool app! Keep improving.

good
"this is actually a really cool app. be honest. especially now that the book updates are pretty fast. It's a bit easy to find a new book even though it's a bit tricky to find. you have to get the right keywords, because sometimes it can't be searched using the title, or the author's name. So, why do you often log out by yourself? though at first it was fine. and when I want to log in, it takes too long and doesn't come in. have to re-launch many times"
"very helpful, hopefully the more people who install it, the reading culture in this country is getting higher"

Please fix the bug. It's really annoying that the app often closes on its own.

why is there always a nerkwort timeout error that makes me angry
"Cool app. Complete collection please. Some books are serialized, some are incomplete. For example, Jonathan Stroud's Lockwood and Co. series. There is no second series. Likewise the Lorien Legacy series (I am Number Four) by Pittacus Lore. The initial series didn't even exist. It would also be nice if old books that were hard to find on the market were displayed. For example the collection of Balai Pustaka, Coraline (Neil Gaiman), Abarat (Clive Barker), etc"
"can't open, njirrrr"
Thanks for borrowing the book.

I have tried many times to login but still can't login. smooth internet signal. thanks please help."
"maybe the books can be supplemented, especially related to psychology"
"I really like this application. We can read books we like, just borrow, wait for the download to finish, then read it right away. Plus it can be read offline too. Only if I may give you a suggestion, can the loan period be extended or not? One week maximum. I can't read that fast. But, overall, everything is good. Hopefully in the future iPusnas can be better and cooler. Keep advancing Indonesian literacy! üòä"
The fiction is dominated by romance. Please add fantasy category. Then if possible the data usage is somewhat reduced. I'm browsing one category of fiction runs out 50mb. Even though it hasn't been downloaded yet.

"the collection is still incomplete, please update again, especially the novels"
this app is very good. but for users who have just downloaded it takes a long time to get to the first page. waste of time. better things can be improved. The rest is of high quality compared to other similar apps.

How do you register? There is no application menu list.

"Very good especially for true book lovers. Indeed, many books that I want to read are not here, but at least I can find other books. I really like the point"
"Thank you, this application is very useful for me, especially for reading interest. But this application is always slow to request a book that I borrow. Even though the network is running smoothly. Thank you, I can't be more useful"
very educational..and practical
"Quite helpful even though the collection is not as complete as the physical library. I hope that in the future the table of contents can truly reflect the table of contents so that you don't have to worry about scrolling manually. It's also a hassle every time I read I can't bookmark, I can't search. as if the menu above when I read it was just a display. Every time I want to continue reading, I always go back to the cover and have to scroll, sometimes I forget what chapter it is."
"it's good, but it still stops on its own"
steadyppp.. favorite app‚ù§

"I will still give 5 stars to the Ipusnas application. My friends and I from literacy volunteers have made it easier with this application because reading no longer has to go through physical books. This is in view of financial constraints and public accessibility to reading materials. Through this application, we can change the orientation of using smartphones to access application-based free reading materials. It would be better if Ipusnas collaborated with activists so that this distribution would continue to expand."

There are many categories of books that I like, such as environmental health, social and psychology. Hopefully this application is increasingly recognized by many people so that it can advance Indonesia through reading. I hope there will be more books"
this is a really good app. sorry just found out now. But please can you add a bookmark feature because it's complicated to find it again and it's added that 3 days of borrowing time is not enough. I hope the knowledge is useful
"This application is very helpful, especially those who don't have much time to go to the library, because it can be opened anywhere and anytime"
those who like to read must download. many choices of books that we can read.. let's make reading culture...

"Previously, after reading the book, when it was closed, and when it was reopened, it would return to the last page read. Now going to the very last page, that's all you have to scroll up, it will take time, especially if you don't remember the page, or the book you've read has a decent number of pages. It's not effective."
I really like this app. But it is often problematic because it often stops suddenly or has to log in again. This is very good for the digital era and minors are already holding gadgets.
With this application Cultivate a culture of reading literacy
Just try not to give two stars first
Why can't register. It often comes out suddenly too. This app is really good though. Please speed up the repair.. thank you

Why when I type a book in the search but it's not there? There is no list of books nor is there any writing. So I can't search for books like that. Why is that please
Keep improving :)
"I'm logged in, but can't find the book I want. even though there are no network problems and the internet is smooth. old version doesn't have much problem like this. please fix it soon."
Less complete
"The application cannot be used properly, there is always a warning that the application has been stopped when opening a downloaded book. Ô∏è"
"Please multiply the books, yeah, sometimes I'm looking for the right book title, I don't find the right one, thank you"
Very good application. Indonesians must install it so that Indonesia's human resources will increase. Greetings literacy
Very nice
Very helpful
This is good but how come there are no interesting novels
It's really hard to borrow a book
"Sis, I intend to find ebook novels, why isn't there any?üòÖüòÖ"
"The application is quite helpful.. for the book, it's added, yes.."
"It's good, it's just that the book collection is only a little"
"I like this application, I have students who buy books is a difficult thing for me to do so this application is very helpful for me, but now I can't open this application so it's difficult to learn, I hope this application can be improved...."
may be useful
It's really good that an application like this has lots of interesting books and can make the younger generation more fond of literacy. My advice is to try to increase the number of good translated novels. That is all and thank you
Looking for books is easy and good for reference
"Why is it, when I search on the search it always doesn't work Even though when the book is on the veranda is there Last night I was still able to search in the search, but why did it get an error this morning"
"The application is unstable, frequent errors, have to uninstall and install over and over"
"Good morning, is the application still under construction? Since last night still can't log in to the app. Please take care of it asap. Thank you."
Unable to register. Not as expected.
why can't you goooooo...
"Why can't I login, every time I log in the apk, the error continues even though I have reinstalled and deleted the data it's still the same"
Why can't I login?? Even though it's been re-installed.
My Ipusnas application suddenly logs out. When I try to log back in with the email I used when registering it always fails. Please fix it
"Want to ask, is it possible to register in the app to hear the number on the National Library card? Thank you"
I am very helped by the existence of this online library.
It's a bit difficult to enter
Ipusnas is very helpful
Why can't I enter the ipunas application?
"Why should borrowing be limited, even though it is a digital library? read mode is a pain. have to scroll one by one."
"It's good, but I want to open the saved one, I can't when I have to search again"
Excellent
"Hi, just a suggestion. maybe the application can be given ""read another time"" a kind of trace, so that when we see an interesting book, we can mark it to be read at another time, for example, if we see that F opens, it seems interesting, but we are still reading books A, B, C. Thank you , the application is very useful"
Interesting
"Lately, every time I open a downloaded book, it's always force closed :( There are several books, one of them: glass sword (Victoria Aveyard) and the ghost bride"
The app is good. But often go out alone and can not read the book. Please fix.
"I want to try it first,,, if it's good then I'll give 5 stars..."
A very good application for people who like to read
very helpful for those who like to read but are lazy to walk
Very helpful
good
Very good
Very supportive.
Pretty good
"Downloading the book is a bit difficult, I was about to finish it suddenly restarted again.. The loan period wasn't long enough, so I was just about to finish and I started borrowing again... the loan didn't download. Downloading the book is a bit difficult, I was about to finish it suddenly restarted... and so on"
"God willing, the application is very useful and God willing, it will make it easier for us to be able to read books."
"It's strange, bin miraculous, technology is very advanced, but Ipusnas takes a moment to ask for a login, you know, Indonesia"
G visa is open
VERY COMFORTABLE
"So it's jammed, always going out when you want to read a borrowed book. Please fix"
WL. Incredibly Helpful!
"Is Haru's book really not available, Sis? Thank you in advance"
"Yes, this application is very helpful, but hopefully the book collection will be reproduced even more, maybe that's all for the others, it's ok"
Extraordinary
"there are a lot of old books, there are no new books, how to make a thesis reference"
Why does the app like to stop on its own??
"bro, how come it can't be copied from Ipusnas windows to word y?"
"probational period. For now, I love it. It's enough to be a medicine for book lovers who haven't had time to go to the library/bookstore because they are busy everyday ‚ù§üíïüíñ"
very helpful in doing the work
Complete book collection
"Why when I want to read a book, I come out disappointed even though I really want to read it :("
"After the update, I can't even read the book because the application keeps coming out. It stops automatically. Please fix it immediately"
"Calculation of the turn of the day at 7 am, the advice is to hurry up to midnight or 5 am"
"Actually it's good, but something is missing, there is no page jump and there is no word search in the book, please let me find it quickly because it takes a long time if you just add it to scrolling, thank you"
why when i open the happy camp story i can't always go out alone
"Sir, please complete the collection. National library period is not complete."
really needed to learn
"A good application is very helpful, the top is really"
"Beneficial. I really like it, thank God Ipusnas really helped me in seeking knowledge. Good luck and keep growing."
"Good app, because it can open me to read books without needing to go to the library"
Help
Can't open it
good bro
Cool üëçüëçüëçüëç
"The application is very good, we can add insight from reading books"
"I love it, there are so many books I want to read. Everything is in here."
Good hope it gets better
"not working,"
"I'm really happy that this application exists but now how come I can't borrow books, it says problem category, why is this, please explain"
Thank God I can finally read to my heart's content
Thanks
"This app is really cool. Because since I read the book from iPusnas, I know that EARTH IS NOT A TRIANGLE OR FLAT"
"The application is cool and useful for me, an elementary school child, but why sometimes when I want to read a book I come out alone"
nice
Need a lot of reference books
Alhamdulillah...a very useful apk..hopefully in the future the features and benefits will be wider
Enough to help me find reading sources for writing or refreshing even though I live in the interior of Kalimantan.
Very nice
"Thank you, the application is useful ... Hopefully the collection of books will be added..."
"The app is unstable, the book has been borrowed but can't be opened and happens in all books"
Suggestions for increasing chemistry books by authors from abroad and within the country too
"Very helpful application, but the loan period is still too short."
"Great, amazing breakthrough Free of charge, I recommend to all friends Very educational"
"I really like ipusnas since it's not a problem, my advice, please increase the collection of books published by wattpad, yes, many young people like me like to read my bca published from wattpad. That's all from me, thank you üòä"
Let's increase interest in reading for the younger generation
"Does Ipusnas intend to make an application? A little bit /force close/, a little /relogin/."
Top
Ipusnas is really cool
"The privilege is sadistic, until you change the system settings of the cellphone. What do you do?"
Cool app
Educate
"Good afternoon Sis, sorry, I want to confirm, is it true that Ipusnas is currently inaccessible? Because I've already installed it twice today but still can't login, even the menu doesn't come out. Please answer, thank you"
"I am happy with Ipusnas, the books are quite complete, especially for those published by the Gramedia Group and Mizan Group publishers. But it's a shame why read ebooks from the Mizan group publisher, the reading mode is different from the Gramedia group, right? Please change it so that the reading mode is the same as the Gramedia group, so that we can see how many pages we read. Continue to let the reading mode scroll the phone screen up instead of sideways, because it's not comfortable. Thank you"
"Very grateful to know Ipusnas after participating in the socialization organized by the National Library of Indonesia. At first it was just a download and didn't try to borrow it. But since there are students who vent if they have assignments and need book references that night. I remember ipusnas. As a result, I logged into Ipusnas and tried to borrow books online. Thank God the books are many and varied. And some can be used as references for students to do assignments. In addition, the file size of the book is also small. So the download process is fast. Because maybe it's not too popular, so the queue for borrowing books isn't long. That night I was able to borrow 3 books. And very satisfied. Reading electronic books on a cellphone is not boring. Because it looks the same as the original book. When I borrowed a book about fashion, the pictures and colors were also very clear. Anyway, the ipusnas application is really recommended for all ages. Because there are many categories of books. There are also children's books such as KKPK. And librarians are also helped by this application. In addition to driving interest in reading. Also to add insight about online reading sources. Thank you National Library for launching Ipusnas. Hopefully, the Ipusnas collection will be more diverse and can be more famous and in demand by the public."
"Why is it that after the update, the book doesn't even appear at all, even though before it was smooth"
When can Ipusnas be used again?
Very good
"Hurry up, Saiki, download it like pkeii gang"
Why can't I download books that have been borrowed? It says file could not be found. Why is that?
Half way to make the application
"After the update there was a collection that was missing, even though I only read a few pages before the update, the title of the collection: sapien by Yuval Noah Harari."
"It's a bit disappointing, it's often the error itself"
why is it so hard to open ipusnas lately even though i have tried many times to open ipusnas. Please update so that it can be used again. Helped by this Ipusnas.
It's a good app
"Okay, I hope the application continues to work without any more disturbances."
Very helpful
Level the specs again..
nice app. I think it would be better if the developer designed this app that couldn't-take-screenshot like in HooQ like that #continue to improve :)
Can not be opened
Extraordinary
first try y
Good soul!
How long did it take to open
How to open it
Why can't the app be opened?
Please update the application.. Error when borrowing the book..
Just installed suddenly can't open
Very helpful
"often go out alone, it's difficult to download books even though the signal is already tight. loading takes too long. please fix it"
"It's really bad, you can't open it once you open it, it just comes out on its own"
"I want to ask why IPusnas can't be opened, right? The reason is network... My network doesn't have a problem??"
"Tumben can't be opened now, is it unstable? No dls trs"
"It's always a problem. Please fix the system again, we are islanders, the books at our place are very limited. We hope that this is the only Ipusnas application."
One of the solutions to the difficulty of books in the interior
"The period after being updated, the problem can't be opened again, I can't read the book I've downloaded even though Ipunas really helped me in my studies, now I can't anymore"
Thanks
Good üëçüëçüëç
"It's a good application, unfortunately there are not many collections. Maybe in the future we can add more books to the collection"
good
Best
"It's great that this application is very helpful for people who are aware of the importance of reading if possible the books are reproduced again, thank you... Once again, thank you üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
"How cool is this iPusnas üëç but my suggestion if you can add more options 'to read' every preview of the book. Because sometimes readers find good books randomly, but because I borrowed the book max that day, the book couldn't be marked/saved so that it could be borrowed and read the next day. If there is an option later, it will make it much easier to mark which book you want to borrow tomorrow, no longer having to write down the title and the author."
"Why is it that every time I open the app it comes out on its own? Please fix. Later when it's good / good like before, I will add a star :)"
Don't lock the pdf. What is the pdf password?
"Just found out that this application exists, it can facilitate my hobby in reading novels, but I'm disappointed why it can't be opened for one day of use the next day? Every email login is always blocked"
Very useful app
not sure
"I can't open it, just enter the logo. Please fix"
"The app is really good. The same is recommended, teacher, I downloaded it and it turned out to be really good :)"
"The application is cool, but sometimes it takes a long time to load if you want to borrow"
Positive and good progress for Indonesia. I hope more people read :D
Can't open
Even though my reading interest is good but why does this apk always have problems with connection problems...please ask related parties to fix it because only this apk provides free online books and this apk can facilitate people who want to read
"I beg for an immediate improvement in this application, because this apk is very helpful for us in the search for books"
It's even faster to download
"How come every time I want to read I always force close, my cellphone is a Zenfone 2 laser."
Very helpful
Excellent
Very good app
I really like it
Not good and incomplete
Very nice
very helpful in the learning process
Finally can be used again
"The application often crashes, I think it's my cellphone, when I tried it on another cellphone it turned out to be the same."
"Just found out that this application exists, I hope it will be very useful, but unfortunately it takes a very long time to install"
"The application crashes. Can't open why huh??? There is no collection of books either. Even though the first time I installed it, everything was there"
Why the app can't be opened
sometimes slow
Very helpful
Thank you. Very helpful
"Thank you for helping a lot, highly recommended for looking for references for college assignments"
"Even though this is my favorite application. But why can't I log in? I finally reinstalled. Later when I can log in, I will give 5 stars"
Lola the process
"Actually this application is very helpful, very good.. But when you want to read a book that you borrow, you have to log in again. When I forget my password, I send it to my email, the link can't be opened :("
Long loading :(
"It takes a long time to load, sis, you keep losing books that you borrow later sometimes make errors but this is a really good application, so you can read translated novels, hehe, thanks"
Why can't it be opened?
Pretty helpful seeeee
"Ipunas is a really good application, you can read books and the books can't be copied and pasted, it's cool, but if you log in, you just have to log out your account, so you have to log in again, and it keeps getting errors when you want to log in, the reason is the internet, even though I'm using wifi, please fix it because When I'm in a hurry, it's really hampering, it's a bit difficult to log in, thank you"
Thank you this application is very useful. But I beg you to fix it soon. I'm having trouble logging in because the app often crashes.
"In the past, the application was fine.. After I updated it.. This application can't be opened.. Thank you ipusnas.."
"There is a problem, it says ""no DLS internet connection"" please solve it"
Why does Ipusnas now say there is no DLS + network like that? Even though I really love this app
"There are some annoying bugs, please improve the app again"
Why can't you register?
"why is the application so slow? . I need a lot of books from here. I can borrow the book, how come I can't. l"
"What can't be accessed, it's better to delete it in the apk, it's useless"
"Why can't login after update? But I still give 5 stars, because it's my favorite application. Awaiting the repair, Mr. Eko., :)"
"Books are not important, there are even important books that don't exist. Even Google Books have far more important books than Ipusnas"
"the application can't be opened, because it's bad I uninstalled it & I gave 1 star"
can not be opened
very useful. the books are of good quality..
How come I can't login...?? I've tried many times but still can't
very helpful
Okay
"HOPE IT CAN BE USEFUL, AND GADGETS ARE NOT JUST FOR PLAYING BUT TO INCREASE SCIENCE THROUGH THIS APPLICATION"
Why is it that after downloading it can't be opened and I've reinstalled it and it still can't be opened...
Why can't the application open after updating and can't log in?? Even though I really need it
Why can't I open the app :( even though there's so much to read?
After updating the added app can't be opened
"Awaited! Greetings to the analyst program, hopefully this application problem will be resolved soon."
The application cannot be opened. How to increase interest in reading. The answer to every complaint is the same.
Want to borrow the error continues
"Socialization is good, the system is not. The collection is large, can't be accessed, the internet is smooth even though, huh."
"It's too long, can't be opened, keeps coming out, how do I want to read, I can't even login, please fix it, thank you"
"Keep on stopping even though there are many book lists but it's useless, I can't read"
Why is the application after updating it can't even be used... I've downloaded the book. Ehh.. it can't be opened and even the application exits by itself.. please fix it again. Let me feel comfortable again when I read it. Thank you
"Well even though it's really good but suddenly it can't be opened, the reason is connection problems even though watching YouTube is really smooth, how about this. Please fix it, because this is really useful for learning and entertainment for reading"

Cool
"I just installed the ipusnas application, why does it say no internet connection and no DSL. what does that mean? Even though I still have a lot of internet quota and a 4G signal. Please help"
Why can't it be opened? Even though I really need a reference for college assignments
The loading process is too long. Whether it's a network problem or the Ipunas server that has a problem
"It's sad that it took so long to heal, I can't open it"
I've installed and uninstalled it 3 times but how come it can't be opened?
Can't open it at all
Please fix it soon
"Disappointed. In the past, I fell in love with this app. Now, he is disappointed. It's wrong too. Why did you love this app so much? Even always proud of this app. In the end, he became hurt himself. It's been updated, but it's hard to use. So I installed. Oh, it's getting harder. He said there is no dsl. How is this? Please help. Please, mba..mas or whoever is behind this, please fix it immediately. Because actually, this app really helps us who need a matkul reference."
When can the apk be opened?
"The book collection is not complete, but it meets the standards"
"before updating, you can enter quickly, after updating it for a long time, if you wait, you can get bored"
Why can't the application be opened?
After updating it often comes out and error
"Why is the book here difficult to access, even though the signal is good"
Ui ux Complicated less simple so confused!
"Why can't this application be opened? Even though I've tried many times, it still doesn't work"

Please fix. I want to borrow a lot of books, but only borrow 1 for a long time naudzubillah"
I can get to know the world better thanks to this app
"Great, very helpful, greetings literacy"
"This application is very, very helpful for me, but how come it can't be accessed at all"
It's been pretty good. But it's better if the application is refined. Frequent error time out even though the internet connection is good
"a very helpful and cool application but why is the application crashing all the time? hard to open, hard to log in, can't borrow books, even though the books I need are there"
"Which now can't be opened, borrowed & downloaded. In fact, there is often a problem with dns writing & it goes out on its own. When will this be fixed?"
Ipusnas... Why is it so hard to download books now? I miss the early release of ipusnas... The loading is fast. Not like now
Good... but the app keeps popping up on its own...
Cool .... Min add wishlist dong for a list of books that will be read ...
"So sad. Already uninstalled, and reinstalled it can't even enter. Really sad. Because Ipusnas has become a real friend. Which makes it easier for us to read various references. Come on, fix it. Total need to be fixed. Especially books that are difficult to install. Hopefully with the improvements, it will make us excited again to read. Thank you ipusnas üòä"
Cant be opened.
"There are still problems, it's hard to enter / login. Even though the network is fine."

I was about to borrow a book and said that the file could not be found. The notification says 'no connection and no DLS' AGAIN!
"Good application, maybe it needs to be improved again to make it more comfortable to useüëç"

I've downloaded it but I can't read it then it's really lola
VERY HELPFUL

"I can never load the details of the book, so it can't be borrowed. Yes, you can search for books using the author's name, but if you can't borrow it, it's okay."
"After updating, you can't borrow"
Why is it that when I open it there is no connection and no DSL?
how long until ipusnas is a problem??
Good especially for information literacy seekers
after the update it can't be accessed.
Why is it that after updating it's even difficult
THANKS
GOOD
How come it can't be opened? no network + DSL .. even though the network is fine ..
"I just updated this app, but can't open it. Though the network is fine"
"Heaven for book addicts but money seekers. Just download and read. Download it using wifi ride again. Super free but never regret to download this. Recommended for students who are busy making KTI. Thanks ipusnas, my cellphone is getting better quality"

"Why can't this application be opened? Even though it seems that if you use the application, it will be easier to access"
Difficult to log in and frequent errors when opening. Please fix it soon
Let alone borrowing books to log in is very difficult even though the network and quota are adequate
Error
A bit tricky
"Can't be opened/borrowed the book, please fix it so it's easier to access"
"Please fix the application, why does it take a long time to open the application and have to log back in. Previously it was fine, why is this application getting harder and harder to use"

What is this app can't open
Please fix
"The application is good. But it's been a few days since I can't access it, so I can't find references. Please fix it immediately."
"A country of this size can't even make an application like this. What is the next country saying? This is Indonesia, where are the IT staff or experts to create good applications. Report Pak Jokowi not feeling well. To the media, our eyes as ambassadors for reading are also not good. Sad to see this country. Taunya is fooling his own people. With a fake application."
"I think when I use the d tab it's slow because the tab and internet have errors'. It's been installed on an Android phone, it turns out that this app isn't clear. This app used to be great. I really like. But for now ckp 1 star. Thank you so much"
"This application is bad, it has been downloaded twice, installed but can't be opened, always the reason is the connection, even though the connection is good, just throw away the package, I downloaded it, it doesn't work, I'm sorry"
thanks to Inpunas because with this application it makes it easier for us as students to find the latest books
Very helpful

"Honestly, this application is really good, simple, makes it easy for people to read books anywhere, there are also many books. But there is only one error, the application is slow, even though my network is good, and I think this one problem can affect many things in the application and make it uncomfortable. Please fix it again sis"
"How come it can't be opened, please respond quickly, please fix it, thanks"
A step to educate the nation. It's a shame the book collection is still incomplete.
Extraordinary!! This application always error and if you want to download the book it always fails
Please fix the application quickly
"I just downloaded and can't access it, it says no network & DSL"
"Why is ipusnad so hard to log in now, please, please update so that reading books can be even easier. Thank you:)"
Can you enter

Very good and useful for bright future
May be useful
This application is really cool.. I don't regret downloading it

"Very good, hopefully the collection of books will increase, especially academic studies, journals are very much needed by students."
"Why do you often go out, when you're looking for a book, the error goes oops oops mulu"
There's a lot of bugs in the app hmm
There are many books that can increase knowledge
"Expand more scientific books, especially on the theory of language, education and literature."
"YEAY! Crazy, even though I just complained a few days ago, now it's fixed right away. Thank you very much, Ipusnas! Sorry if I complain too much :)"
"Often force close, entry is also difficult, even though it can be very useful"
This Ipusnas sucks. God level loading. Get out on your own. Keep on not knowing our account even though I'm not logged out. Maybe this book is not important in Indonesia. so the application is not made wholeheartedly. So remember the reason 'why Indonesian films' are rarely watched is because there are few cinemas. Books are worse. It turns out.
"If books can be borrowed longer or can be downloaded, this application will be very satisfying"
"After the update can't even borrow books, please fix it"
Very recommended for Ipusnas. Best ebook app
develop yourself with knowledge
Thank God the application is smooth
Why can't the application be opened? And how come online member registration can't work? Errors continue. Amazed
"Very good, because you can easily access books to broaden yourself"
More reference songs.. Especially law books
Can you add more books on the science of da'wah?
"Just downloaded the application, it's bad. Instantly delete the app"
"I installed pusnas since its release and updated it as early as possible. Why ? Because since there was an update the app was messed up. Starting from the slow loading of the boot, the loss of book history data, the borrowing process does not work, and all kinds of things. The more updates or new facilities/features are given, there are always problems. I actually miss the first (early) version of the National Center for Health, it's easy, not complicated. Please fix."
"Why do you want to open a book that has already been downloaded, but it just comes out by itself?"
"It's sad that the application can't be opened until now, I've tried to uninstall it, see the comments, it's not just me... but the app really helps a college kid like me... :((((((("
The application is ok
Thank you
Kudos to Ipusnas now it can be opened... but how come I can't borrow books... Login is difficult... Borrowing books is hard... Hadeehh...
"the app keeps crashing. sometimes book data is deleted by itself even though the borrowing period has not been completed, so you have to re-download it. please fix it. Also, I want suggestions, please increase your literary collections (such as Pramoedya and Sutardji Calzoum Bachri), also please increase historical books such as under the banner of revolution. Thank you."

Why always network timeout? Even though the connection is smooth.

Why can't the application be used? The network is bad even though in other applications the network is smooth

Why can't it open

"So, I'm late to know that there is an app like this. It's really cool, so now I'm holding on to my phone for a long time, it's more useful because it's for reading. And the cool thing is, the books are decent, I like reading novels and some of my favorite writers can read their books here.

The application is difficult to open even though it has been updated. Keep having to log in again and again. Please fix
Excellent
Good... Unfortunately there are still many books that are not available

The application can't be opened e
Nice app. Please increase the collection of new books
"It's even better, don't make mistakes.. But thank God."
Cool

Applications that strongly support literacy programs
"Good, but how do you read it offline?"
"The application is good, but there are still bugs, I have to log in every time I open the application and there are network problems, even though when I open YouTube it runs smoothly. . . The application is very good and I thank the parties involved for providing this online library application. My advice for the future is to increase the collection of books, especially agricultural lecture books. I am an agricultural student who needs an online book loan. Because if you have to buy, the price is quite expensive. Continued success for pusnas :)"
"Often force close yourself, the sample is confused, why, ha ha"
"Very bad. It can't be used, it's difficult to download, every time you log in, you always log out yourself, please make it easier"
"Thank you for the application, through this apk, it is easy for me to find references to write a thesis and also I can read the book I want. But there is one book that is not available, namely the book ""God without religion"" by Russell! Hopefully this book can be quickly updated in the apk."
I'm giving 3 stars because I keep failing to log in... Please help... Looks like this application is very helpful...and I'm sure of it
"Often out alone. Later, if you open it again, you have to download it again, staying up late must log in from the beginning. I download a book 1 title up to 7 times a day. Because it came out on its own when it was read"
Very useful application. Especially for students :)
"It used to be easy to access, but when I open it now, it's so difficult, it takes a long time to enter and I can't even borrow books.. Even though the wifi and cellular data connections work well"
No ads..
Not good breastfeeding
Can't log in. Long time out. Just uninstall it.
"How come after I installed it, I can't open this application, why?"
nice
"This app is very helpful. It's just that there are still books that are incomplete, such as books on public relations which are still difficult to find. It would be nice to add to the reading list, especially those that support lectures and final assignments. As well as increasing the amount in borrowing books."
"The application can't be used and it's very difficult to log in, the books you're looking for can't be found"
Hopefully it will add insight
"Very good because there are a lot of free books the app is decent, the interface is good, unfortunately the icon looks like it's broken on my cellphone, this is quite strange because most apps must use the svg vector icon which can't be broken even when zoomed in as big as it is, or some use icons font.. and when scrolling through the book list, it's still not comfortable, it doesn't lag, it's just that the thumbnail for the book cover isn't fast enough to load, which makes it a bit stifling. Maybe because many people have access, so the server is overloaded."
"Min, what items are you holding? How come I can't borrow, the announcement is ""you don't have a hold item yet"""
nice
Why did this last app have an error? Please fix it soon Thank you
Cool
Very useful looking for lecture materials.
"Sorry, I am really excited about the Ipusnas application because it is more effective, but the availability of books is still minimal. The problem I faced was that I couldn't login even though the signal wasn't bad and I used the Telkomsel operator. login account via fb or google still can't because it doesn't connect. sad.. even though the signal is loud haha. thanks."
"How come I can't log in, it says no connection, even though my internet is very smooth"
"Ipusnas is very good. Large collection. Unfortunately, lately it's hard to download stories. The system should be further improved."
Can not be opened.
upgrade again
Hopefully it's easier to read
"Very useful and helpful especially for those of us who like to read, however, now the process is a bit slow, the process is not as fast as before, hopefully in the future it can be even better, because this application is very useful Thank you"
"The longer the more disappointing this application. I used to really like it because logging in was easy and downloading the book was also good. Duh, how come it's decreased, please return it to how it used to be."
I like the app
It's actually good...it's just that it's often difficult to log in and suddenly like to exit the application itself....
Overall good. But on my smartphone it's a full 4G network but I can't access it. Please develop and improve again. Thank you
"How come it takes so long to log in with Lola, please improve, OK? :)"
"The application is lacking, why when I want to enter the application it stops?"
"The policy of limiting book lending to a maximum of 3 titles per day is too troublesome, can it be programmed better? . Where to read have to borrow. If it turns out that after borrowing the contents are not as expected, they will be returned. So, if the user has returned the borrowed ebook again, he should be given the right to borrow another title up to a maximum of 3 titles, and if the second loan is still not as expected, the user can borrow three titles in the third loan after all the second loans are returned. Please note, because the limitation of borrowing 3 titles per day without paying attention to this will only make it difficult for users who are interested in reading the ebook provided by ipusnas to read. After all, Ipusnas contains digital books, not printed books. Thank you."
"I only have 2 days to borrow the book, if I can add 1 week. If you spend internet quota, you have to always download it. very stingy."
"My ipusnas application can't be used, it's very difficult to download stories, and now it's even difficult to log in, every time I try to login, it fails even though the password and email entered are correct. What's wrong with Ipusnas? Ô∏è"
"Sometimes it's hard to open, even though there's a data package"
"Recommendations for reading books for free, many new books. BUT if it's an error, it's annoying to ask for forgiveness. It's hard to borrow books, usually it's hard to log in when you get an error."
good
Thank you ipusnas. Good luck always :)
Please fix the loading process because it's been difficult for 2 days to enter. Greetings literacy
Actually really like this application. But why is it often unknown error lately
"Please fix the bugs again, loading takes a long time"
"Booting into the apps is easier, it takes too long to enter and the loading takes too long, the theme is more eye-catching, huh... overall everything is good, hopefully it will be better"
"I don't know why every time I open this application, the internet connection is bad, the signal drops. But when switching to another application it's just fine"
The app is amazing it helped me.. Thank you
Thank God it helps
I like this app. why is it hard to login now? Previously you could...
"As for the book, I like it. It's just that there is a problem with the login, I don't have an account. But in this application there is no sign up feature. I am confused about how to use this application. Please fix it again. That is all and thank you"
Useful apps keep going
Useful app... Keep improving!
"The application is really good, just a suggestion, bro, if you can add the reading feature, so that it doesn't hurt to read at night, the loading time is often problematic, thank you, min, the application is great"
Thank you for providing easy access to knowledge.
Add collection dong
"This is why, it takes a long time to load and often force closes. even though my internet is stable and pretty fast."
"It's bad, apps, time out terooss. Unable to login and register account. Bad, bad. Luckily there are no ads haha"
Very nice
Can't login using Facebook
Thank God I can borrow books for free. You can read anywhere without having to carry a heavy book with you. Thank you
Looking forward to the addition of the book!
"The collection of books is quite large. But unfortunately, after upgrading the application, there are often problems, every time you open the application you have to log in again. Books that have been previously borrowed must be downloaded again every time they are read. Hopefully in the future this application will be even better."
"Loading takes a long time, often timeouts even though the network isn't bad either"
How come I can't log in using my email? Already logged in but still can't
"Alhamdulillah, it's a good application, if you can add more books"
Reading culture
Very good thank you
How come I can't login and I can't register as a member
"I really like it, it's fast. Very helpful for completing college assignments :)) Hopefully the books will be more and more complete, thank you :) The additional hope is that you can read the contents of the book first before borrowing, so it's like being able to read directly on the spot without having to borrow. That's all :))"
nice app
This application is very useful. Unfortunately very often suddenly logout itself. Hopefully in the future it will be better and add to the collection of books.
It would be better if added a night mode feature.
"it's good, but add a wishlist feature"
"I added the application, how come it's getting worse every day, I wonder how hard it is to connect, suddenly logout and the account can be deleted by itself. After yesterday's criticism, it didn't improve, it just got worse, logging in is difficult, borrowing is difficult, then what's the use of this application even though the connection is smooth, it's ridiculous! Please help, I'm an IPusnas fan, the application is being improved, I often log out from this new account, it's clear that my account was suddenly deleted, it's not clear Then I have to create another account, even if the app is updated, the size should not be too large because IPusnas memory is only using internal memory, please pay attention to the user's real memory capacity, for research books, especially for the final semester and lecturers, especially the use of statistical analysis software other than SPSS such as eviews etc. Please add it. Psychology books, especially textbooks for college, collections of investment books and securities analysis are also still very minimal. Please multiply, hopefully it will develop and progress in Indonesian education!"
"It's honest, guys. At first it was okay, it went well. Ehh, when it's been a while, there are often errors. For example, if a new book is borrowed one day, it's gone the next day. Simply put, one book has to be borrowed several times to read it. And that's really annoying. My advice, please improve the quality"
"How come I can't sign up, I'm even told to log in, haven't made a password yet, I'm told to log in"
Now it's a bit difficult to open the application. It takes a long time to load and often logs out itself. Even though there's still a lot of signal and cellular data.
Thank you for ipusnas. Now I can read ebooks anytime and anywhere. But Ipusnas must always keep updating various books because there are still many books that are lacking. I want all the books by Tere Liye and Ahmad Rifai Rifan to be available in this ipusnas application. Thank you and best regards
"Hello. Sorry admin, why do you get frequent errors after logging in? Thank you"
often force close suddenly and sometimes can't login
"It's been very good, but lately it's been loading a lot, it's hard to borrow a book, you have to do it several times to get it. Please fix."
So you don't need to be confused about looking for references or just want to fill your spare time with useful things
"Please fix the system. At the beginning, the use of Ipusnas was more comfortable. But now the application is very slow to open even though the network is good. And every time you log in, you have to register again and again"
Cool
"Why does it take so long to load, even though the signal is good. Eh, it's been a long time since I've been loading the app, but the app just stops. Every time I want to download, the signal immediately disappears, even before entering the application, it's fine"
"it's slow, it's not playing, even though I'm already using a 4G modem"
Add more books Recommendations add comet book from tere Liye
make it easy
Fb login is very slow even though you use WiFi
steady
"With Ipusnas, I can find reading materials easily. I used to be confused if I wanted to read a novel, I wanted to buy it, I didn't have the money, even if I had it, I'd rather buy textbooks. Borrow from the library, the book is the same. Alhamdulillah, found this application."
"Hello iPusnas admin. This is why my iPusnas account logged out by myself? Then when I log in, there is a network timeout notice. It's been counted 2x like that. And I want to log in can't. But if you click, forget the password, you can."
"Very helpful. Wherever you can open knowledge, without being limited by time and place"
nice
Excellent. Continue to maintain and enrich the digital book collection.
"The application is good, it's just that the book is not complete. When you type log in using Facebook or email, you are logged in, but you continue to log out, so every time you open this application, you have to log in again."
So excited
Sometimes there are still bugs. Like not responding or closing itself
Applications often error

"With the ipusnas application, it is very helpful in enriching knowledge through reading, it's just that it's a little difficult for me to enter.."
Very nice! Make it easier for us students to find references to support lessons
"helps in increasing and growing interest in reading for those who are only glued to gadgets. My advice is to add the borrowing time, so you don't get bored. so as not to borrow repeatedly, and the appearance is somewhat updated. I give all stars, if the stars in the sky I can not give. Oh, one more thing, please add the history book volumes 1 and 2 by Prof. Ahmad Mansur Suryanegara. Thanks ipusnas :))))"
Keep up the books hehe
I wish there were more users. Suitable for areas far from the library.
"The chemist stephenie meyer and city of heavenly fire novels Cassandra Clare cannot be borrowed. Admin, please also make John Grisham's novel. Because it's good. Thank you"

Really good!!
I can't login using facebook instead the network time out
"Ipusnas, please, improve the quality again. My account likes to suddenly log out by itself. When you want to enter, it's hard to ask for forgiveness. Today I just tried many times and won't log in anymore. Please guide how to do this?"
"The app is good and useful. But, stop and go out incessantly. Sometimes the ebooks that I download fail. The rest is good."
Thank God... It's no longer difficult to find a library :)
Thank you very much for providing an excellent platform for literacy.
"Overall okay. It's just a search engine when it's in the collection and e
library generally takes quite a long time. Add more,
often when I don't open it for a few days when I enter the application I have to log in
in again and it's quite difficult to login. Just that. Please fix ipusnas.
Thank you~"

A little advice from us about searching for book categories. It seems less

I usually wait for a few hours and then open the app again. only,
This time it seems he needs to protest. This disease appears again but with variations
new. He said that the problem has been fixed 'ipusnas has stopped' but it still looks like

"It's good that the app is very helpful because I like reading, but sometimes I still get errors myself :) i.e. this app likes to stop or close itself. And sometimes books that have been borrowed tend to disappear by themselves from my bookshelf even though I'm half way through reading or even I have to start reading again from the beginning, even though I like to click on the page divider. But thank you very much National Library for making this app :)"
"Really recommend, there are also many variations, from fiction, tips & tricks to reference books"
"How come it doesn't look like the original book? even though the format of the old version of the book is like the original book. If it's like the original book, we can easily quote in scientific writings."
Hopefully in the future there will be a feature to upload books / writings.. Indonesia is smart with a love for reading and writing
"Sorry, I want to ask in advance how many days can I borrow a book? Then if the loan period is over, will my bku automatically disappear from the bookshelf?"

This application is good. However some of the books I was looking for are still not available in the collection.
"It's good, I'm just confused about wanting to read a certain book, you have to enter the queue list even though there's no one reading it"
I like it because I can read books for free and also the collection of books is quite complete. Unfortunately the application is currently unable to be used again because it says that the application has stopped. It's also very unfortunate because suddenly I just exited by myself while reading a book in the application
"The loan period, if you can, is 1 week, if you only read the book for 3 days, you can't relax"
Really good. Keep updating the book collection.
"Pretty good. But please add to the collection of books. And for a maximum of borrowing books per day, not only 3. Moreover, the loan period is only 2 days"
"Always appears ""Ipunas has stopped"" every time I want to borrow a book."

"It's been pretty good. There are many inspiring books, but there are still many good books that are not yet available. Regarding convenience, it's actually user friendly, but when logging in sometimes it takes a long time and it keeps failing, when it's logged in, it logs out automaticallyüòì"
Cool:)
Very good app
"Read, read, read. Thanks ipusnas top..."
It's very easy wherever it is important that there is a package and signal.....wkwkwk

"It's really good so it's not difficult to find a book. Thank you for the application, it's very helpful for us students in making final assignments"
Can you login yet?
Can make it easier to find references
"Yesterday I was able to borrow a book, it's my turn to log in again, I can't, please.."
Sorry I gave 3 stars first...
Very useful.. I hope my book can also contribute to the National Library
The book is incomplete

Good and useful.... But why can't you change the avatar?

Big thanks for this apps, hopefully more and more people will use this application so that the reading culture will not be destroyed"
I can't enter the app when it asks for permission to exit the app.
"Great, continue to be victorious for the National Library for intelligent Indonesian people"
Thank you
Can you increase the loan time?
really cool
"The best Apps. Please continue to add the book, min :) May Allah reward admin's kindness :)"
quite complete
"I got to know this app from my mother who works at the national library, her name is Mrs. Hikmah.. she told me to use this app because she knows I like to read and like to go to the library.. it turned out to be a very good app."
"This is why I often come out alone even though I was just about to read Andrea Hirata's father. This makes me unhappy, especially since I have downloaded the application using muota"
Very good for improving Indonesian reading culture
"The application still has bugs when scrolling down the search menu... if you can add a page search feature, so it's nice to find what you're looking for. Thank you"
I do not like.
Often go out alone
"It's been borrowed when I want to open the book, how come the application comes out. Please fix it soon"
"Loading continues, can't open the book category... even though the connection is fast"
"Why can't you borrow this? It said there was a problem with the server. Please fix it, I need it...."
Why can't I borrow books? Thank you for your attention
"why can't you borrow a book?? why the application error?? please fix the application immediately min. I want to borrow Milea Suara's novel from Dilan which happens to be in stock, but I can't."
The books are appropriate and have various kinds... Unfortunately there are still errors when I want to borrow
"Very nice. Cool and very helpful. If it was equipped with pages instead of having to scroll when browsing books, it would be even better. And please add a translation category so that the searching doesn't get mixed up. Btw, from 1 pm to 2 this morning, ipusnas just got an error. Tried reinstalling it's the same. Please fix it."
Application error can't borrow books
Why can't this be accessed? The writing continues to load problem books categories???
"I am happy with the efforts of the National library which has made an application as cool as this, and can be a solution for readers wherever they are. And one more suggestion to add back books related to law, and Islamic law."
"Please help, I'm downloading and it's already at 100% but after that it goes back to 1% again, this has been repeated 3 times, asking for a solution"
"A good application and very helpful for the development of literacy culture in Indonesia, but why have you been having trouble lately and can't open it. Hope it can be fixed soon"
Make sure ipusnas doesn't get any more errors
Error. Please fix
Please this is why I can't borrow books
"This is a new application error, right??"
"Actually this application is very good and quite helpful for me. But, when I log out I then log in again the application error. Please respond. Thank you."
Why is it so difficult to log in every time? Even though I have reinstalled many times
"Ipusnas again why now, I want to read can not. I can't even log in to my email, it just says ""no data"" ("":"
"Please, this app, why can't I borrow a book now, yesterday it's normal, now it's hard to enter"
For the past two days there has been an error when opening the homepage.
"Very helpful, quite good, but unfortunately there are books that cannot be opened, always force close, the name of the book is basic social science, author Idad Suhada. Please review. Thank you"
Why can't I open the app...
Very nice
"Please fix the application, there is an error, I can't log in and out myself again"
"The book is reproduced and the writing is made so that it fits the cellphone screen, thank you"
"Hopefully it will be fixed again later when it's updated, my complaint is the same as the previous comments, and 2 or 3 days it's been a nuisance, for some reason. Oh yeah, I've read quite a lot on Ipusnas, why is my status not going up even if I'm still reading less than five books, is it my cellphone that has an error or is there a problem with the app? I'll add a little bit, hopefully there will be some publishers who don't have any books at all, such as Republika, Gagas, Experts, I don't know Ipusnas isn't yet in its collection or they haven't made an ebook yet, but I hope to continue to add to their collection. Of the several IPerpus I have tried, Ipusnas is the most complete and the one with the fewest errors. Happy reading"
"Sorry, yes, the application can still be opened, but the loading error is slow, it can't load any data.. let alone reading the login, the error continues.."
"Good innovation to develop reading culture in this country. However, this application still has many bugs that need to be fixed. Please be given the register feature via email. Because there is only a login feature without registration. Hopefully better future."
Ntaps
"Min, why does my Ipusnas have an error that I can't view or borrow books, sir. Other library applications also can't be opened, how about this, min?"
"How come I can't log in, I've tried several times but it still doesn't work"
"It's a problem, my cellphone can network even though there is no connection... please fix it, thx"
Very nice
"Sometimes it's often not connected, even though the signal is good . Sometimes books that have been borrowed and have not yet been returned cannot be opened offline. Even though I really like this application, it is very useful, like a library function in general, and can be accessed anywhere. If there is a system update or something else that might interfere with access, it will be informed to the user. So that we can be warned or something. That's all for my input, I hope that the National Library of Indonesia application can improve its performance more optimally and add books, especially literature and language, (I rarely find it hehe)."
"At first the application was very good and smooth, but over time when logging into the application the error continued and there was a notification that your connection was bad even though I was already using the office wifi. Until now it still can't be synced"
"Please help, I have installed the app, it's good, I like it, but I don't open the app for a week, when I open it again, I can't open it, reload it, even though it's a 4g network. Why is that, please help and answer?"
good jon
"This application is very good, it's just that please fix the crash when filling in the password to register in ePustaka. And improve the performance when scrolling books so it doesn't lag. Thank you"

"The application is very helpful, it makes it easy for me to find reference books for written works when I don't have time to go to the library. Thank you, hopefully the application can continue to be improved."
"Why is this, please wait. How do you log in?"
"That's all, because I've downloaded 2 times, I can't enter at all"
"A very useful application, but why are you limited to borrowing only 3 books a day??"
"The app is good. But it would be even better if this app added a preview function before borrowing :) So, before borrowing (where the number of loans per day is only limited to three), borrowers can think about it before actually borrowing it. Thank you"
Very nice
"The app is very good and useful. But what I want to ask is, is the loan period only 2 days, it can't be longer (7 days maybe). Explanation please. But overall excellent"
Aaaw love it..Thanks! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
"Sorry admin,, this is very good and very useful...

I'm majoring in chemistry so I want to look for it the book in this apk... Please, sir, please develop it again, so that all students know and get a lot of knowledge!! thanks"
"Thank God, it is very noble for those who have created this application so that we can read books instead of having to pay for them, and the maker of this application has provided knowledge for free, I'm actually looking for references for proposals, the intention was to buy books, when I got this application, it actually helped, Once I say thank you for the maker of this application, I hope it will continue to be successful for the developer of this application."
Why do you often stop? So I can't read a book

Very cool. Easier to reach..
There are still frequent bugs and more books are added
"The most favorite app right now. He just often stops himself, now he can't even open it. The rest is good and helpful for me personally in reading..."
Great. It's even better if the collection is in the pond again
"This application is very helpful especially for students who are currently running a literacy program. Please create a feature that helps us select books based on the most read, and rating in percent form. Thus, readers are more comfortable in choosing books, especially for novice readers."
Can't change profile photo and often logs out a day later
Very helpful
"Very good. I support this application. My advice is to add various types of books, both old and new books. üòäüòâ"
Very helpful in fulfilling additional readings
"The application is good enough, but there are some books whose contents do not match the title. Permission to access the camera and storage is also a little worrying, I haven't put a profile picture yet but someone else's face is already filled in. I'm worried that my face will also fill other people's profiles. If permission is not granted the application cannot operate. Please improve and guarantee more security. Thank you."
"Really like this app. Add insight, knowledge and entertaining. Thank you very much ^^"
"Please develop more, for example, increase the time of borrowing, and increase the collection"
"Thank you, now I can and the application is very good and very useful, keep improving, good luck, amen"

"The application is helpful and useful, hopefully it will be blessed and can make it easier for the Indonesian people to add insight... amen"
"J3 It's difficult to enter, even though I like reading books"
"That's good. It's just, why does every time I open the application it take a long time to load? It's the wrong application or my cellphone."
"Min, may I know how long the validity period of the borrowed book is?"
Thank you
"There are several books that have been downloaded, but the application force closes when you want to read the book.. one of them is my father's book (Andrea Hirata).. Please fix it immediately..."
Very nice ...
Having a library makes us smart
"Alhamdulillah finally after comparing all e-book applications, I found this application free, very suitable for those of you who want to be practical."

It's a bit lacking if all the books are in this application. Better to add more books.

"4 Previously, because I just tried..."
"This is the app I've been looking for. Developing yourself by reading, this is one of the facilities for self-development. Thank you government."
It's a good application to fill my spare time....
It's really good so you don't have to bother going to the library
"Every time I borrow, I always force close. Samsung J7Prime"
"Good, only the popular collection is incomplete"
"the ""quantum touch"" book is only 55 pages, if so...why are all pages 40 to 55 blank...please check"
So I can read books without buying or bothering to go to the library. And it's quite a savings compared to renting comics and novels. It's fun... Btw how do you go up to bookworm? I've borrowed 14 books but it's not checked in the status
Very good..
Like a library but a nice appsss
"Very useful, min, so don't bother going to the library"
Thank you for your hard work
"Excuse me admin.. Very useful application. I see that anyone who uploads books can be from anyone. My suggestion might be to add a report menu if there are books with bad content.. If there are mistakes in my words, I apologize and correct them.. Thank you. Happy reading"
Perfection
"Please provide books for those who are already queuing. Don't when you're already in a queue, you're late to open the book notification, you're running out again, so you have to queue again. Don't go on. Thank you. Please pay more attention."
"Every time the book comes out, you have to download it again, even after downloading it, you can't open the book and the download process repeats itself automatically"

Incredibly cool. Please make more English books

Min how are you? I've downloaded the app for a 55 MB laptop. But why can't it be installed on a laptop? How's that?
I like this. Add collection
I quite like this application. But please develop it so that it can be used on a laptop or computer
"Min lnp, every time I open the application, then rotate it to force close? ... if it can be equipped with the jump feature, and page search so you don't get tired of scrolling. Everything else is okay."
Very useful for me personally but I don't know how to copy and save the book I borrowed to the drive application..Thanks
"Thank you ipusnas my loyal friend. Admin, please fix it, the application likes to suddenly come out on its own when you're reading, it takes too long to load, hopefully after the update it won't work anymore. Anyway, waiting for more collections of his books. Do you have an account to chat with admin? Maybe Instagram?"
"Cool application and very helpful, especially for friends who like to read. Suggestion, if you can add more history book collections. Thank you"
soooo!!
Oath. Account login via facebook account but it's hard x.
"If you're searching for books and scrolling down too much, the list of books suddenly disappears and you have to start from scratch. Please fix"
"Nice app. Without going to the library, you can read books that are as complete as in the library. We recommend adding a ""read later"" feature so you can save an interesting reading list to read later."
nice
Can't login at all either by using facebook or email Very disappointing
"I think this application is good, very helpful. However, I want to ask, if for example on a PC it can also be done, but why does it load so much the first time I open it. ."
"Hopefully the latest books will continue to be updated, thank you ipusnas"
"Min, why can't I login, Facebook can't, email doesn't work either.. I forgot my password, but when I got the link, I clicked on the contents, there was an error.

Anyway this app is good

"Expand the collection of books in the library. And take care of the old books. Because books are books, they won't turn into trash."
"Ipusnas is my favorite app for reading books. Many books are sold in bookstores and can be read in this app for free. Thank you Ipusnas, Keep going!!! :)"
"Cool. All the books are up to date. Only, sometimes problems often occur while loading. It's okay."
Connection errors often occur in this application even though the cellphone is already connected to the internet
"Book history in the profile, if possible, for the same book or frequently borrowed books, at least one book is stored, so that the history is not filled with the same books and makes it easier to borrow books that have been read. Thank you"
Alhamdulillah... This application is very useful and helps me in compiling my thesis...
"It is very useful to increase people's reading interest, but the drawback is that it is difficult to open when the network is unstable."
Alhamdulillah... this app treats my longing for the library that I used to frequent during school
"Very good, of course it would be better if the number of copies was increased for books with a lot of queues. Thank you"
why can't I open the password reset link from the email sent by ipusnas???
Does the app use a data connection or not?
"It's actually good, but, the more updated the application, the more errors this application, especially now that connection errors often occur in it, for the admins of the IPUSNAS application, please help to fix it immediately. For the common good."
thanks..very useful
"It's pretty good..... But unfortunately I haven't been to the 24th floor at that time #AnakMTSN Kawunganten, Cilacap"
Very helpful for those who are less affordable than bookstores
"This application is very helpful, the book collection needs to be added and updated, unfortunately, since it was updated to Ipusnas 2.2, it can't even open notifications, hiks....."
How come you can't log in?
"A very helpful application to meet the needs of reading books without the need to go anywhere. It's just that lately it seems that there are often errors and can't save bookmarks from books that have been borrowed. Notifications also can't be opened even though the notification numbers appear. Hopefully it can be resolved soon, thank you"
"With this application, I can read as many books as possible"
"Continue to develop this application, it is very useful"

nice
Thank God this application is very helpful.. But how come it's hard to log in after updating
"It's been cool enough to help. Please, this is just an input suggestion, for the reader, a fix feature is added to the text so that the small screen is helped, you don't need to zoom and slide. The app is good."
OK
Still need improvement and improvement. But I really appreciate it because this application is very helpful for reading books for free. While I give 3 stars first while waiting for improvements and improvements from these apps :)
"Why the hell, here the books are good. Why download a little? Though here is more useful than reading that is not. The only problem is loading long, even though the network is normal. Keep developing :)"
"It's better than nothing, the national library class still often reads a downloaded book, it closes itself, after that, send a report, woah."
"How come the connection doesn't work, my network is okay, how come it's not pending anymore."
"For the book, it's good but sometimes what you're looking for isn't there"
It's good
"This application is very useful for those of us who live in areas with minimal references and readings. Please multiply the book. Please group the books by category, because many of the books I found did not fit the categories listed. The process of returning books sometimes fails so that when borrowing a book it also fails because the maximum borrowing is still valid even though the book has been returned."
Very helpful but unfortunately it often fails to login to my account..
"Bad! Can't log in. Even though the signal is good, when I want to log on it immediately disappears"
I really like and need ipusnas. Please help so that the settings are compatible with Asus fonepad 7. Thank you.
Very helpful. But please fix when having trouble logging in and so on. Because it makes it very ineffective. Even though the internet connection is also smooth. Hope it's a correction.
"When logging in the app takes a long time, likes to log out, try to make it easier for the app to login! It's really hard why is it so difficult to log in___-"
"Long login. Sorry, I give one star"
"It already has a good design, but it's a shame it's still often encountered connection failures in its users. Even though the tendency of today's youth likes to share things that are fast. If this problem is not immediately addressed, young people will be less interested in finding information here. Faster on google he said. Please my wisdom as the user is still not satisfied with this application"
"Most children's books, please add books on management, techniques. Because the ones who use this application the most are children? They mostly play gamesüòÇ But adults need a lot of references to keep upgrading skills so they can bring this nation up from all its adversity"
Useful apps
Application error can't log in and always logs out by itself
The application often has difficulty logging in to the account and the application reloads continuously. So it can not read comfortably.
"I'm really grateful because of this application, I can read books anywhere and anytime and certainly can add insight, but the application is still having problems, and please improve it again... Thank you ipusnas"
"Very petrified and also interesting but please fix it again sometimes I can't log into my account plus the book I borrowed is missing on my bookshelf plus when I want to continue my reading yesterday the marker on the book wasn't there so I had to remember the last page I read it, please fix it again and multiply the references"
Can't use the app anymore? Should be activated again because it is very useful. for the nation's children who are thirsty for knowledge.
"It's good, but why do you often release the application yourself, so how come I can't borrow the book?"
Very helpful
Can't log in
Love it. I hope you keep updating the book.
Can not login

Upload a little
"I really appreciate this application. Because it can help increase insight in terms of science. But it would be better, please fix the connection problem so that it can be easier to access. Thank you."
Easy to crash and take a long time if you want to log in using a Facebook account. Please allow
"Ask for help for the developer, immediately fix the crashing sectors.. for the past few weeks the application has always been loading errors and sometimes the application exits by itself. Thank you."
very useful application concept
"How do you want to download it, and how do you want the younger generation to move forward if the reading app runs out like this? I want to enter my account, my password is wrong, but it's all correct... The server can be fixed, please"
Very good
"The collection is not satisfactory, but enough to add to the reading. Why now have to re-register? I'm reading Jose Saramago's novel, it's almost finished, and unfortunately it can't be found in search engines, so I've been relying on the History feature to re-download it, and of course it's only in my old account. PS: Jose Saramago is one of the important writers, and Blindness is also one of his important novels. As far as I know it is the only novel of his that has been translated into Indonesian. Hopefully the search engine, and the app as a whole, gets fixed soon."
Need more improvement. Bugs often occur when borrowing
"I wanted to read books at the National Library of Indonesia, but I was hampered by the location and time of college, because I also happened to have a National Library card. This is a good application, but it's hard to log in, time out, that's what it says. Thank you"
"I am very grateful for a very useful application like ipusnas, it really helped me in getting reading references, especially the text books that I used for college. If I may suggest, please improve it even more because several times I have had difficulty logging in to Ipusnas"
Why can't you come in?
"How come I can't login, via email or fb, the same can't even load. Enter for Ipusnas, if you are already logged in, you shouldn't need to log in again. Thank you"
"This app is really good, but it takes a long time to log in. I'm tired of waiting too long"
"How do I register, there seems to be a problem with the application? The rest, thank you for trying to educate the nation"
"Very useful, but there are still problems with the system, please improve and develop again. Thank you ipusnas cool üëç"
"Actually really like this application. But unfortunately, lately the error continues. Can't find books by category. It says network error. I have a good network though. Please improve more. It's a shame if the results are not optimal. This app is cool."
Cool
Very nice. Just often force close. The loading is too long
Sad.... Even though the application is good. It's a shame how come you often get errors now. I can not enter. My account is also unreadable so I can't borrow
Why can't login
"It still often goes out by itself, and there is no information on how long the loan period will be."
"now the apk is still problematic, please fix it quickly"
This application is good..very useful..increasing the reader's insight..it's just that it's been 2 days I can't search for books like usual..why?
Application is not clear. No need to download
I like the existence of ipusnas but there is a persistent login problem. I can't enter
Thank you iPusnas for the books. Very helpful when traveling and the application sometimes likes to get errors. Hopefully in the future it can be even better üòä
"The application is good, but when I borrow the novel, there are no more queues. Please fix it..."
I keep loading huh?
Very good for progress and character building. But the loan time is very short
"This app has a lot of problems! Though I just want to read! My network and internet connection is good. Just repeatedly in a row ""ipusnas stopped""! Every time you enter you have to login, sometimes when you want to log in the column disappears by itself. After that ""ipusnas stops"" Borrowing books sometimes can't, report no response, let alone repair! How about this ?! Or do I uninstall?!"
"I really like this app, keep updating books about my knowledge, especially math and physics , I hope the connection will be more stable... Proud you... üôè"
Why can't I login :(
Excellent
"I was very happy when I found this application, but the application still keeps getting errors, suddenly I can't open the details of the book, it says there is no internet, even though others can have internet....hopefully in the future things like this can be fixed"

"Very good, maybe in the future it will be given a page jump feature so the scroll doesn't need to be too much"
I like it. Thank you very helpful
"After updating, I can't even borrow books anymore"
good application but often error.. ask to login.. failed to login.. your book to save
"This application can be useful for people who need it, but how come every ePustaka list takes a long time to load and sometimes it fails"
Cool
"Uninstalled and then installed repeatedly, still can't enter, even though the network is okay, everything is okay"
"I enjoy ipusnas which provides free books and no need to queue. It's a shame sometimes when I open it suddenly I can't, as I experienced today, 3 dec 2017"
"An application that is very useful for all people, it's just that there are often network errors, difficult to load, etc"
"I give 5 stars because the benefits of this application are amazing, please fix the error, okay?"
"I really like this application, but my suggestion is to add a page number search feature in the ebook. Because sometimes when the borrowing time is up and downloading again, we are not directed to the last page read. So you have to scroll again from above, which is a problem if your reading is far away, it can take time to scroll. Not efficient. I hope my suggestion can be considered. Continued success for Ipusnas, hopefully there will be more useful books that can add information and knowledge."
Why is it so difficult to log in?
I really liked it before but getting here is getting more and more unresponsive. I will be disappointed if there is no improvement.
It's good
"The book is good, but I have failed to log in several times even though it was smooth before. I fail to log in using Facebook which is always on, and it takes a long time to load"
"It's a good idea to present this application, cm after updating the application it often crashes, for developers maybe it needs to be fixed again. it's a shame this good application can't be used."
"The application is good and the collection makes me wuah in my heart. Please improve the performance, the application often comes out on its own, thank you"
üëçüëç
"How come I can't enter... How can I do this, please help"
"Please fix it.. Lately the error has been frequent, I'm getting bored in and out of the application. Delete and then download the application again because the application can't login"
Why is there no dear nathan?
"I often go out alone, don't I?"
"The application is good, very helpful But unfortunately, the system crashes too often, especially when it is most needed Hopefully in the future it will be even better, especially the system for searching for books"
"The application is good, it's just that it often force closes so it's a little annoying"
"The application is good and very useful, there are two things to note, first after logging out I can't log back in either with Facebook or Email, I've uninstalled the app and tried logging in again but still can't, I suggest adding a login feature with a Google account , which is easier to use. Second, the search feature is often problematic, sometimes nothing appears, and if you can add a search feature, for example, search for publishers, year of publication, or author. Thank you..."
"Really like the app. But since last night, why can't I find another book? Then, if you want to borrow again, you can't. How about this, sir/ma'am/sir/ma'am?"
"why is it so hard to log in again, and the serch can't be used, so I uninstalled it and wanted to install it again, but the rest to borrow is because of the network or what?"
the search feature doesn't work.. please fix it
"The application is good and very helpful, but there are still bugs, please fix it"
"I really like this app. Makes it easy to find the books we want and also as a means of increasing knowledge. But sometimes the book can be read offline, sometimes not and the borrowing time limit is only 3 days, if you can add it to 7 days"
"As long as I use this application, I feel satisfied. However, if possible, please complete the collection again, because I wanted to find the book I was looking for to see the reviews. But the book doesn't exist. In addition, the books I borrow always disappear automatically on the shelves even though I haven't read the book one day. Please understand :)"
It's a bit slow to load
"The application is good and very useful but is hampered by signal connection, so it is a bit slow to open, and the search menu sometimes has problems"
"This application is difficult to open. The connection often fails. I just want to look for a book, it's a long wait"
"I really like the ipusnas application, it makes it easy to read from home because the library is far away. Hopefully in the future more interesting features will be added, and above all, the collection will be expanded! :)"
"Why is the application when I opened it, suddenly came out by itself,, until now it can't be opened again, I had to reinstall it, but it's still the same (suddenly came out of the application itself), why is that??"
"I can't open it yesterday, I can open the application"
I like
Always error when searching!
"This is the application error that often occurs, what is my bad signal?"
"Before borrowing a book, I hope that the table of contents is shown first, so that you don't borrow the wrong book, thank you, please apply it immediatelyüëè"
"The concept of this application is good and will have great benefits, but unfortunately you still often encounter connection errors/failures when interacting between menus in the application, please improve and develop. Thank you"
"This application is a must-have for book and science lovers. The books available are not junk books, but quality books, especially scientific books. Thanks to National Library for providing this application so that our access to the world of science is more open. My only suggestion is a few blank pages even though they have been downloaded. Maybe it can be perfected by the maker of this application."
"I want to log in, why is it so hard"
Up to . educative
Add more copies so you don't have to wait long
Greetings literacy
Thank you ipusnas for the very useful knowledge
Why error. Every time I type a book in the search nothing appears. Please fix
"Good application, as a means of increasing knowledge. Tap the application, it seems that there is a problem, after the update can't find books, books that have been borrowed can't change pages... Hopefully it can be improved."
"All of a sudden, I came out alone. Now I can't even search for books"
"Good application but often errors starting from not being able to search, borrowing books, and often going out alone Please fix it to make it more comfortable to use"
Why is the search button not working?
"Why can't I log in even though I'm using wifi, where is the network error, it says, please fix it quickly..."
"Gosh, this is really good.. the book is complete and everything can be borrowed. So it's easy to find information. Thank you National Library ‚ù§‚ù§"
"This ipusnas application is very good for the wider community and Indonesia because it can provide insight and knowledge so that ipusnas is better in the future Suggestion: please ask for more storage space so I can borrow/read more books, thanks ipusnas keep working again"
Very nice
Downloading is very difficult
Can you add the Cosmos book by Carl Sagan or not? Because it's a good book
"Why can't I customize the eReader of the book I borrowed, right? the font is too small, hard to read, but can't be enlarged. :<"
"Great, whoever made it, thank you so much it helped"
good
"Please, please increase the collection of books"
"Haven't used it yet, if you don't have frequent errors, don't add a star"
"Lately, the application has been experiencing errors. GBS opens. TBA2 closes by itself"
"Hello Ipusnas, I am a new member of ipusnas, previously I have been a member of the online library for a long time. I am very happy because the books at Ipusnas are more complete and plentiful. It's just a shame, a lot of books in the ecatalog category are empty and the writing is 0 copies. I want to get information, what is the difference between ecatalog and popular, and if. I want to search for books in the popular category, is there a division by category as in the general collection. Thank you"
"Many of my book wishlists are here. I feel very grateful. At first I was a bit confused about the list, but after searching on Google, I just understood. Reviews: 1. I don't know how much the book borrowing limit is (I've been to 4) 2. The payback period is 3 days. If it exceeds, the book will be returned automatically. I wish there was an *'extend'* mode to make it easier so you don't have to return books and then borrow again. 3. You have to be patient because when you roll down, this library always loads data. So, make sure the quota is not too limited. 4. You have to be patient, if the book you are looking for is empty and there are many 'queues'. I'm still not familiar with that mode. I have to re-enter my password. *The question is, will there be a notification when the book is in stock?* 5. Even if the data is off or there is no quota, the books that you have borrowed can still be read 6. The books here are published by several publishers that I know: Grasindo, Gramedia, KPG, Mizan , Puspaswara, Bentang, I haven't found a gagasmedia or Haru publisher yet. I hope there is..üòÜüòÜ7. When you want to borrow, make sure the quota is not problematic. . Looks like that first... this app is very helpful. Thank you. üòäüòäüòä happy readingüòÜüòÜüòÜ"
How come the application often comes out if the category is changed. Even though I want to change to the student BSE category
I swear... It's really hard to login... Even though I'm already a registered member... :(
"The application is good, but the collection is not complete. There are also some books whose display quality is not good. Hopefully tomorrow there will be a search feature for the author's name, which he has in his chest specifically for the books he has written."
Always fixed.m
"I like this application. However, please increase the variety of books and improve the system, which sometimes makes errors, especially when a book that I have borrowed is sometimes lost on the bookshelf even though it hasn't been a day since I borrowed it."
I just downloaded ipusnas but why can't I log in?
"Very helpful! I was honestly looking forward to being able to read the book digitally to get an overview of its contents for free. Only after I feel comfortable with the contents, I will buy the hardcopy version because I prefer reading hardcopy. This application allows me to borrow good books without having to come directly to the place. I really look forward to the collection being more complete with publishers who are also okay to have such as UI Press, UGM Press, IPB Press, Kompas Gramedia, Rosda, Grasindo, Elex Media, Bhuana Popular Science, Qibla, etc. I also hope that there will be digital magazines issued by Kompas Gramedia as well as scientific journals such as those from LIPI, UI, UGM, etc. in digital form. Keep going RI Library!"
"Why is it often unresponsive lately? When I wanted to borrow a book, I couldn't even.. Then I was told to enter an email or connect to FB.. I've been waiting for a long time, I haven't opened it either. In the end, I couldn't read the book. Please fix it min."
very long loading..........
Very good.. but now how come it can't be searched in the book?

Hopefully with this application the knowledge that can be obtained will be more blessed and add to the knowledge that is increasingly widespread.. Amen..üëç
Cannot open the book list. Login via email and Facebook can't. The network doesn't exist even though you can open something else
"Lately it's been a lot of errors. If the error, I have to uninstall and then install again. If you just wait a few days, nothing will change unless you reinstall it. But too often I have to. So annoyed."
"I really like the apk, it just takes a long time to load, but I don't like it, just improve it :)"
I like reading
"Great, hmmmz"

There are still many bugs
"Sorry, why can't it be searched? When I click on the search, the book doesn't appear"
Why is it that when I try to search the book I want to read but the search results don't appear?

Alhamdulillah add insight
Help improve memory
"Thank you, it really helped me in doing my homework"
I love reading. And this app gives me media to read. But unfortunately the queue to read the popular book was very long . But overall I like it so much
"The app is okay, but there are some books that every time you want to read they come out of the app themselves, while reading others is normal"
"Very useful and educational app. It's just that the content is incomplete and not up to date. Add more collections, especially for students who are looking for reference books. Thank you iPusnas admin, for creating a very useful application."
Like to go out alone to long fix it
Cool app

Why do bugs happen so often in the app?/
Knowledge in sight...
Unfortunately there are many who are in demand but it's not free
Cool
"Satisfied and satisfied, it makes it easier for us as students and book lovers to read online"
"mantaab... There's still a lot that needs to be fixed. 1 There is no reading mode on the books. So it's a bit difficult to read because of the small writing when reading on a 4.7 inch cellphone. If it's in reading mode. We'd love to read it, bro. Then there is no time to write books. For example, 3 days must be extended or reversed. If it is not extended for 3 days, it will automatically return. Suppose. Because sorry for the queue. Or if you can. Books that can be borrowed are unlimited. So that's good, we can read any book, no need to queue."
"I like this application. Instead of opening social media, it's better to open Ipunas. You will get knowledge there, not fake news that makes you blunt."
The loan period is only two days. Not much.
"very useful. can read books anywhere, without having to bring books."
"After finding this one reading application, I like reading more"
"I've downloaded this from the first time I downloaded it, only a few dozen people, the improvement is good, I can read online, but sometimes the app still bugs out."
Very helpful for reference list
Thank you. Quite helpful.. hopefully it will be better in the future.
"If you can add more books to your collection, sometimes the downloaded book is lost on the shelf, and you have to re-download it."
Very good.. but unfortunately still confused with the page.. likes to jump..
"How about trying to find a book in the search, the books appear when I want to scroll, but the book can't be found, it's clear that I've already found it"
The database is enlarged so that more and more books can be searched... especially books published in old school...
"Assalamualaikum, admin and developers from the national library, just a few suggestions for reference books if you can add more especially references for lecture books, and please include history books, and stories from various regions in Indonesia, greetings to national literacy, greetings reading , for the golden generation of Indonesia.."
"Really good, but how come I can't borrow the book that's in the queue, I've tried logging in, but it still doesn't work, please help!! Pleaseüòä"
This national library is very useful for students who are looking for books
"It's not like the first before the update. There are a lot of bugs, I think..., Cz dr ramq still has a lot left"
"This application is very useful. But the drawback is the queue time is too long. Example... The book is entitled ""because we don't know"" and ""first they killed my father"". Since I installed this application a year ago, until now the two books have not been able to be borrowed because of the queue... Please respond to the relevant team so that this application can be more stable in the future."
Very good. Especially if you can't get the book in the library around the house. Very helpful

"Want to borrow a book, download it for a long time, let alone read it"
"It turned out that the books I was looking for could not be found here (grade S1). I think Indonesian authors should prioritize books over books from abroad. And very few sharia books, too many conventional (general)"

Please fix it so that no more users are disappointed."
hope to innovate..
It's great.. Looking for college books is so much easier

Finally able to read too.
Love it
"Very good application, really helpful for people whose areas don't have a library. Thank you for making an app like this. However, the book collection is incomplete. Stephen Hawking, Ken Wilter isn't there. Please make more foreign books, please."
"A very boring application, making someone even more unhappy with reading, there are still many shortcomings, the application continues to open less and less and is complete."
Please add more literature-themed books üôè
Make it easier for Indonesian people to improve their reading power. Let's read.
"I'm so excited that I was so lazy to read books, so be diligent because we don't have to bother carrying books üòä"
"Apps are good, but please add a wish list feature for books you want to read so it doesn't make it difficult for users to find books they want to read, also add a recommendation feature based on books that have been read. Several times I experienced a force close of use, please fix it."

"Very good application, please make more copies, so you don't have to wait long"
Why can't I log in now? Yesterday I could....
"It is even easier for readers who want to study a science seriously if a scientific systematic guide feature and reading books are provided in stages and a scientific discussion room is provided. So far, this app is the best."
"What is this, can't borrow books. I'm really sorry I downloaded this app"
"Download suddenly the book is lost, sometimes it can't be opened. But it's okay."
Very useful application. Is very good...
Borrowing time if you can add
"The loan period should be extended, not just 3 days because it is too short. My advice min. A week, so that it's good to read, don't be in a hurry and the knowledge will enter."
"The application is useful. But why every time there is no result for a book search, and all book categories can't be selected (can't be clicked) I can't do a book search and borrow books"
"I often log out myself, the loan time is very short.. please extend it and add more book collections.."
"I really like Ipusnas, I can read a lot of books about Hacking, Networking, Programming, etc. Ipusnas is OKAY :D"
Just opened and closed by yourself
"Admin.. the application suddenly stopped, there have been more than 20 interruptions for a week, the system suggests uninstalling but I still need it.. please fix it, bro.."
"Not bad, to make it easier to use what these apps look like. And keep logging out of your own ram specs even though it's enough. Thank you.."
Interested.. But unfortunately it just opened and force close.
Force close when opening Book Queue
Good app
"It's amazing,,, from this application it becomes smarter, can read books from anywhere,,, hopefully in the future it will be even better."
Why did you go out alone? Can't enter?
"The app is good and helpful, but there are many good books that the queue is too long"
If you login using Facebook you can't but if you use email you can. Please add a widget for the book being read..
"Please fix the server, it often doesn't connect, it's hard to borrow... It's hard to return it too"
"I just downloaded the book, the title is dral sudirman, i didn't read it yet and then exited the application when i wanted to read it i had to download it again, this sucks, other books aren't like that, please friends, can you give a solution so it's not like that"
I like this app
Can you add a menu to distinguish which books are still free and which have to be queued.... So you don't have to search one by one.....
"I like this app. But after I update, often books that have been downloaded have to be downloaded again. Like I'm looking for a novel and it's been downloaded, it's being read in the middle of the road then I close the application. When I opened it again it turned out that I had to download it again. And not just one or two books."
Try it first
Very nice
I like
"After the update, why is it getting worse? The app stops by itself."
"The book is incomplete, especially the book that contains theory, please add it if you can find a book with isbn"
Reading is my hobby. So I really support this application... Really a very good recommendation..
The validity period is too short. Better to extend it again.
nice
Force close
"Assalamualaikum Wr. Wb I really like this ipusnas application, it is very helpful for making tgs. But I need to add more books, there are some books I'm looking for but they're not there. Success, Ipusnas üëç Oh, I want to know at iPusnas, aren't there scientific research journals like that? Please include scientific research journals that are scientific. Let's be cooler. Thanks"
Sometimes if we search for a book and scroll down the search results suddenly the results are gone. Please fix this in the future. Thank you.
"The application is very good, you can read it anywhere. But can this be shared via Facebook? I tried one book, but it doesn't work"
"Very nice !! I can read a lot of novels. Suggestions, please add more copies of the book, so that there are not many people queuing for the book :("
"Still don't understand how to become a member, you have to log in to Facebook but it's taking too long, please guide me"
The application likes to stop by itself and sometimes it can't be opened
iPusnas is very fun. I can read books that I haven't had the chance to physically buy/own. The problem is still often force close. Please update immediately so that no more force closes occur. Thank you

Thank you Forward the Spirit of Literacy."

"As a loyal Ipusnas user, I don't get tired of giving suggestions for the development of this application from my point of view as a user. I really like reading books at Ipusnas considering the number of books available and can be read very much. However, there are obstacles that I experienced that may also be experienced by other Ipusnas users. The obstacle is the amount of memory that must be provided if there are several books with large file sizes. Or want to borrow 3 books at once which is then accumulated causing the required memory is also relatively large to download. So the input I want to convey is that if the developer PT. Woolu Aksaramaya can develop this ipusnas so that the application can be set so that it can be moved to the external memory of the cellphone so that later it doesn't burden the phone's internal memory. I hope this little wish of mine can be granted. Fully respect from your little user. Good luck made in Indonesia applicationüí™üí™üí™"
Thank you.. for the maker of this application.. My old hobby can be channeled now..
